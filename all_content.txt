Transformer Block 1
### What is Transformer?
✕
**Transformer** is the core architecture behind modern AI, powering models like ChatGPT and Gemini. Introduced in 2017, it revolutionized how AI processes information. The same architecture is used for training on massive datasets and for inference to generate outputs. Here we use GPT-2 (small), simpler than newer ones but perfect for learning the fundamentals.
Transformers aren't magic—they build text step by step by asking:
> "What is the most probable next word that will follow this input?" 
Here we explore how a trained model generates text. Write your own text or use an example, then click **Generate** to see it in action. If the model isn’t ready yet, try another **Example**.
Transformer has three main parts:
1
**Embeddings** turn text into numbers.
2
**Transformer blocks** mix information with Self-Attention and refine it with an MLP.
3
**Probabilities** determine the likelihood of each next token.
Before a Transformer can use text, it first breaks it into small units and represents each as a list of numbers (vector). This process is called **embedding** , and the term can refer to both the process and the resulting vector.
In this tool, each vector appears as a rectangle, and hovering over it shows its size.
**Tokenization** splits input text into tokens—small units like words or parts of words. GPT-2 (small) has 50,257 token vocabulary, each with a unique ID.
In the **token embedding** step, every token is matched to a 768-number vector from a large lookup table. These vectors are learned during training to best represent each token’s meaning.
Word order matters in language. **Positional encoding** gives each token information about its place in the sequence.
GPT-2 does this by adding a learned positional embedding to the token's embedding, but newer models may use other methods, like RoPE, which encodes position by rotating certain vectors. All aim to help the model understand order in text.
A **Transformer block** is the main unit of processing in the model. It has two parts:
  * **Multi-head self-attention** – lets tokens share information
  * **MLP** – refines each token's details


Models stack many blocks so token representations become richer as they pass through. GPT-2 (small) has 12 of them.
**Self-attention** lets the model decide which parts of the input are most relevant to each token. This helps it capture meaning and relationships, even between far-apart words.
In **multi-head** form, the model runs several attention processes in parallel, each focusing on different patterns in the text.
To perform self-attention, each token's embedding is transformed into three new embeddings— Query, Key, and Value. This transformation is done by applying different weights and biases to each token embedding. These parameters (weights and biases), are optimized through training.
Once created, Queries compare with Keys to measure relevance, and this relevance is used to weight the Values.
After creating Q, K, and V embeddings, the model splits them into several **heads** (12 in GPT-2 small). Each head works with its own smaller set of Q/K/V, focusing on different patterns in the text—like grammar, meaning, or long-range links.
Multiple heads let the model learn many kinds of relationships in parallel, making its understanding richer.
In each head, the model decides how much each token focuses on others:
  * **Dot Product** – Multiply matching numbers in Query/Key vectors, sum to get attention scores.
  * **Mask** – Hide future tokens so it can't peek ahead.
  * **Softmax** – Convert scores to probabilities, each row summing to 1, showing focus on earlier tokens.


Each head multiplies its attention scores with the Value embeddings to produce its attention output—a refined representation of each token after considering context.
GPT-2 (small) has 12 such outputs, which are concatenated to form a single vector of the original size (768 numbers).
The attention output goes through an **MLP** to refine token representations. A Linear layer changes embedding values and size using learned weights and bias, then a non-linear activation decides how much each value passes.
Many activation types exist; GPT-2 uses **GELU** , which lets small values pass partially and large values pass fully, helping capture both subtle and strong patterns.
After all Transformer blocks, the last token's output embedding, enriched with context from all previous tokens, is multiplied by learned weights in a final layer.
This produces **logits** , 50,257 numbers—one for each token in GPT-2’s vocabulary—that indicate how likely each token is to come next.
Logits are just raw scores. To make them easier to interpret, we convert them into **probabilities** between 0 and 1, where all add up to 1. This tells us the likelihood of each token being the next word.
Instead of always picking the highest-probability token, we can use different selection strategies to balance safety and creativity in the generated text.
**Temperature** works by scaling the logits before turning them into probabilities. A **low temperature** (e.g., 0.2) makes large logits even larger and small ones smaller, favoring the highest-scoring tokens and leading to more **predictable choices**. A **high temperature** (e.g., 1.0 or above) flattens the differences, making less likely tokens more competitive and leading to more **creative outputs**.
Finally, we need a strategy to pick the next token. Many exist, but here are common ones: Greedy search picks the top one. **Top-k** keeps only the k most likely tokens, and **top-p** keeps the smallest set whose total probability is at least p—trimming unlikely ones early.
Then softmax turns the remaining logits into probabilities, and one token is picked at random from the allowed set.
Transformers have extra features that enhance the model performance but aren't core to understanding the basics. For example, a **residual connection** adds a layer's input to its output, keeping information and learning signals from fading through many layers. In GPT-2, it's used twice per block to train deeper stacks effectively.
**Layer Normalization** helps stabilize both training and inference by adjusting input numbers so their mean and variance stay consistent. This makes the model less sensitive to its starting weights and helps it learn more effectively. In GPT-2, it's applied before self-attention, before the MLP, and once more before the final output.
During training, **dropout** randomly turns off some connections between numbers so the model doesn't overfit to specific patterns. This helps it learn features that generalize better. GPT-2 uses it, but newer LLMs often skip it because they train on huge datasets and overfitting is less of a problem. In inference, dropout is turned off.

# What is a Transformer?
Transformer is a neural network architecture that has fundamentally changed the approach to Artificial Intelligence. Transformer was first introduced in the seminal paper ["Attention is All You Need"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3295222.3295349 "ACM Digital Library") in 2017 and has since become the go-to architecture for deep learning models, powering text-generative models like OpenAI's **GPT** , Meta's **Llama** , and Google's **Gemini**. Beyond text, Transformer is also applied in [audio generation](https://huggingface.co/learn/audio-course/en/chapter3/introduction "Hugging Face"), [image recognition](https://huggingface.co/learn/computer-vision-course/unit3/vision-transformers/vision-transformers-for-image-classification "Hugging Face"), [protein structure prediction](https://elifesciences.org/articles/82819 "eLife"), and even [game playing](https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/reinforcement-learning-plus-transformers-equals-efficiency/ "Deep Learning AI"), demonstrating its versatility across numerous domains.
Fundamentally, text-generative Transformer models operate on the principle of **next-word prediction** : given a text prompt from the user, what is the _most probable next word_ that will follow this input? The core innovation and power of Transformers lie in their use of self-attention mechanism, which allows them to process entire sequences and capture long-range dependencies more effectively than previous architectures.
GPT-2 family of models are prominent examples of text-generative Transformers. Transformer Explainer is powered by the [GPT-2](https://huggingface.co/openai-community/gpt2 "Hugging Face") (small) model which has 124 million parameters. While it is not the latest or most powerful Transformer model, it shares many of the same architectural components and principles found in the current state-of-the-art models making it an ideal starting point for understanding the basics.
# Transformer Architecture
Every text-generative Transformer consists of these **three key components** :
  1. **Embedding** : Text input is divided into smaller units called tokens, which can be words or subwords. These tokens are converted into numerical vectors called embeddings, which capture the semantic meaning of words.
  2. **Transformer Block** is the fundamental building block of the model that processes and transforms the input data. Each block includes: 
     * **Attention Mechanism** , the core component of the Transformer block. It allows tokens to communicate with other tokens, capturing contextual information and relationships between words.
     * **MLP (Multilayer Perceptron) Layer** , a feed-forward network that operates on each token independently. While the goal of the attention layer is to route information between tokens, the goal of the MLP is to refine each token's representation.
  3. **Output Probabilities** : The final linear and softmax layers transform the processed embeddings into probabilities, enabling the model to make predictions about the next token in a sequence.


## Embedding
Let's say you want to generate text using a Transformer model. You add the prompt like this one: `“Data visualization empowers users to”`. This input needs to be converted into a format that the model can understand and process. That is where embedding comes in: it transforms the text into a numerical representation that the model can work with. To convert a prompt into embedding, we need to 1) tokenize the input, 2) obtain token embeddings, 3) add positional information, and finally 4) add up token and position encodings to get the final embedding. Let’s see how each of these steps is done.
![](https://poloclub.github.io/transformer-explainer/article_assets/embedding.png)
Figure 1. Expanding the Embedding layer view, showing how the input prompt is converted to a vector representation. The process involves (1) Tokenization, (2) Token Embedding, (3) Positional Encoding, and (4) Final Embedding.
### Step 1: Tokenization
Tokenization is the process of breaking down the input text into smaller, more manageable pieces called tokens. These tokens can be a word or a subword. The words `"Data"` and `"visualization"` correspond to unique tokens, while the word `"empowers"` is split into two tokens. The full vocabulary of tokens is decided before training the model: GPT-2's vocabulary has `50,257` unique tokens. Now that we split our input text into tokens with distinct IDs, we can obtain their vector representation from embeddings.
### Step 2. Token Embedding
GPT-2 (small) represents each token in the vocabulary as a 768-dimensional vector; the dimension of the vector depends on the model. These embedding vectors are stored in a matrix of shape `(50,257, 768)`, containing approximately 39 million parameters! This extensive matrix allows the model to assign semantic meaning to each token.
### Step 3. Positional Encoding
The Embedding layer also encodes information about each token's position in the input prompt. Different models use various methods for positional encoding. GPT-2 trains its own positional encoding matrix from scratch, integrating it directly into the training process.
### Step 4. Final Embedding
Finally, we sum the token and positional encodings to get the final embedding representation. This combined representation captures both the semantic meaning of the tokens and their position in the input sequence.
## Transformer Block
The core of the Transformer's processing lies in the Transformer block, which comprises multi-head self-attention and a Multi-Layer Perceptron layer. Most models consist of multiple such blocks that are stacked sequentially one after the other. The token representations evolve through layers, from the first block to the last one, allowing the model to build up an intricate understanding of each token. This layered approach leads to higher-order representations of the input. The GPT-2 (small) model we are examining consists of `12` such blocks.
### Multi-Head Self-Attention
The self-attention mechanism enables the model to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence, allowing it to capture complex relationships and dependencies within the data. Let’s look at how this self-attention is computed step-by-step.
#### Step 1: Query, Key, and Value Matrices
![](https://poloclub.github.io/transformer-explainer/article_assets/QKV.png)
QKVij=(∑d=1768Embeddingi,d⋅Weightsd,j)+Biasj QKV_{ij} = ( \sum_{d=1}^{768} \text{Embedding}_{i,d} \cdot \text{Weights}_{d,j}) + \text{Bias}_j QKVij​=(d=1∑768​Embeddingi,d​⋅Weightsd,j​)+Biasj​
Figure 2. Computing Query, Key, and Value matrices from the original embedding.
Each token's embedding vector is transformed into three vectors: Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V). These vectors are derived by multiplying the input embedding matrix with learned weight matrices for Q, K, and V. Here's a web search analogy to help us build some intuition behind these matrices:
  * **Query (Q)** is the search text you type in the search engine bar. This is the token you want to _"find more information about"_.
  * **Key (K)** is the title of each web page in the search result window. It represents the possible tokens the query can attend to.
  * **Value (V)** is the actual content of web pages shown. Once we matched the appropriate search term (Query) with the relevant results (Key), we want to get the content (Value) of the most relevant pages.


By using these QKV values, the model can calculate attention scores, which determine how much focus each token should receive when generating predictions.
#### Step 2: Multi-Head Splitting
Query, key, and Value vectors are split into multiple heads—in GPT-2 (small)'s case, into `12` heads. Each head processes a segment of the embeddings independently, capturing different syntactic and semantic relationships. This design facilitates parallel learning of diverse linguistic features, enhancing the model's representational power.
#### Step 3: Masked Self-Attention
In each head, we perform masked self-attention calculations. This mechanism allows the model to generate sequences by focusing on relevant parts of the input while preventing access to future tokens.
![](https://poloclub.github.io/transformer-explainer/article_assets/attention.png)
Figure 3. Using Query, Key, and Value matrices to calculate masked self-attention.
  * **Attention Score** : The dot product of Query and Key matrices determines the alignment of each query with each key, producing a square matrix that reflects the relationship between all input tokens.
  * **Masking** : A mask is applied to the upper triangle of the attention matrix to prevent the model from accessing future tokens, setting these values to negative infinity. The model needs to learn how to predict the next token without “peeking” into the future.
  * **Softmax** : After masking, the attention score is converted into probability by the softmax operation which takes the exponent of each attention score. Each row of the matrix sums up to one and indicates the relevance of every other token to the left of it.


#### Step 4: Output and Concatenation
The model uses the masked self-attention scores and multiplies them with the Value matrix to get the final output of the self-attention mechanism. GPT-2 has `12` self-attention heads, each capturing different relationships between tokens. The outputs of these heads are concatenated and passed through a linear projection.
### MLP: Multi-Layer Perceptron
![](https://poloclub.github.io/transformer-explainer/article_assets/mlp.png)
Figure 4. Using MLP layer to project the self-attention representations into higher dimensions to enhance the model's representational capacity.
After the multiple heads of self-attention capture the diverse relationships between the input tokens, the concatenated outputs are passed through the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) layer to enhance the model's representational capacity. The MLP block consists of two linear transformations with a GELU activation function in between. The first linear transformation increases the dimensionality of the input four-fold from `768` to `3072`. The second linear transformation reduces the dimensionality back to the original size of `768`, ensuring that the subsequent layers receive inputs of consistent dimensions. Unlike the self-attention mechanism, the MLP processes tokens independently and simply map them from one representation to another.
## Output Probabilities
After the input has been processed through all Transformer blocks, the output is passed through the final linear layer to prepare it for token prediction. This layer projects the final representations into a `50,257` dimensional space, where every token in the vocabulary has a corresponding value called `logit`. Any token can be the next word, so this process allows us to simply rank these tokens by their likelihood of being that next word. We then apply the softmax function to convert the logits into a probability distribution that sums to one. This will allow us to sample the next token based on its likelihood.
![](https://poloclub.github.io/transformer-explainer/article_assets/softmax.png)
Figure 5. Each token in the vocabulary is assigned a probability based on the model's output logits. These probabilities determine the likelihood of each token being the next word in the sequence.
The final step is to generate the next token by sampling from this distribution The `temperature` hyperparameter plays a critical role in this process. Mathematically speaking, it is a very simple operation: model output logits are simply divided by the `temperature`:
  * `temperature = 1`: Dividing logits by one has no effect on the softmax outputs.
  * `temperature < 1`: Lower temperature makes the model more confident and deterministic by sharpening the probability distribution, leading to more predictable outputs.
  * `temperature > 1`: Higher temperature creates a softer probability distribution, allowing for more randomness in the generated text – what some refer to as model _“creativity”_.


In addition, the sampling process can be further refined using `top-k` and `top-p` parameters:
  * `top-k sampling`: Limits the candidate tokens to the top k tokens with the highest probabilities, filtering out less likely options.
  * `top-p sampling`: Considers the smallest set of tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds a threshold p, ensuring that only the most likely tokens contribute while still allowing for diversity.


By tuning `temperature`, `top-k`, and `top-p`, you can balance between deterministic and diverse outputs, tailoring the model's behavior to your specific needs.
## Advanced Architectural Features
There are several advanced architectural features that enhance the performance of Transformer models. While important for the model's overall performance, they are not as important for understanding the core concepts of the architecture. Layer Normalization, Dropout, and Residual Connections are crucial components in Transformer models, particularly during the training phase. Layer Normalization stabilizes training and helps the model converge faster. Dropout prevents overfitting by randomly deactivating neurons. Residual Connections allows gradients to flow directly through the network and helps to prevent the vanishing gradient problem.
### Layer Normalization
Layer Normalization helps to stabilize the training process and improves convergence. It works by normalizing the inputs across the features, ensuring that the mean and variance of the activations are consistent. This normalization helps mitigate issues related to internal covariate shift, allowing the model to learn more effectively and reducing the sensitivity to the initial weights. Layer Normalization is applied twice in each Transformer block, once before the self-attention mechanism and once before the MLP layer.
### Dropout
Dropout is a regularization technique used to prevent overfitting in neural networks by randomly setting a fraction of model weights to zero during training. This encourages the model to learn more robust features and reduces dependency on specific neurons, helping the network generalize better to new, unseen data. During model inference, dropout is deactivated. This essentially means that we are using an ensemble of the trained subnetworks, which leads to a better model performance.
### Residual Connections
Residual connections were first introduced in the ResNet model in 2015. This architectural innovation revolutionized deep learning by enabling the training of very deep neural networks. Essentially, residual connections are shortcuts that bypass one or more layers, adding the input of a layer to its output. This helps mitigate the vanishing gradient problem, making it easier to train deep networks with multiple Transformer blocks stacked on top of each other. In GPT-2, residual connections are used twice within each Transformer block: once before the MLP and once after, ensuring that gradients flow more easily, and earlier layers receive sufficient updates during backpropagation.
# Interactive Features
Transformer Explainer is built to be interactive and allows you to explore the inner workings of the Transformer. Here are some of the interactive features you can play with:
  * **Input your own text sequence** to see how the model processes it and predicts the next word. Explore attention weights, intermediate computations, and see how the final output probabilities are calculated.
  * **Use temperature slider** to control the randomness of the model’s predictions. Explore how you can make the model output more deterministic or more creative by changing the temperature value.
  * **Select top-k and top-p sampling methods** to adjust sampling behavior during inference. Experiment with different values and see how the probability distribution changes and influences the model's predictions.
  * **Interact with attention maps** to see how the model focuses on different tokens in the input sequence. Hover over tokens to highlight their attention weights and explore how the model captures context and relationships between words.

Hi, I'm Aeree, ![](https://aereeeee.github.io/assets/gt.bb45c602.png)Georgia Tech ML Ph.D. student working with [Polo Chau](https://poloclub.github.io/polochau/).  

**ML** models more **interpretable** and**explainable** through **interactive visualizations** that amplify human’s ability to understand and interact with AI systems.  

After 5+ years as a software engineer—most recently at ![](https://aereeeee.github.io/assets/amazon.b081a4d4.webp)Amazon and ![](https://aereeeee.github.io/)NAVER—I returned to academia to explore human-centered AI research. Drawing on a B.F.A. in Visual Communication Design and an M.S. in CS, I bridge design and technology. My work has been recognized with the Best Poster Award at the 2024 IEEE VIS (for [Transformer Explainer](https://poloclub.github.io/transformer-explainer/)), among other accolades in design, journalism, and HCI.

My research focuses on the **security** and **explainability** of multimodal foundation models. I work on developing explanations for ML systems, analyzing them to identify vulnerabilities, and finding solutions to mitigate these issues. My work spans a wide range of application areas, including multi-object robust tracking in computer vision, developing defenses against attacks on large language models, and understanding large language models and the insights they can give us into human interactions. I have also worked with 3D simulation software like CARLA and Unreal Engine. 
I am currently a PhD student at Georgia Tech advised by [Polo Chau](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dchau/) as a part of the [Polo Club of Data Science](http://poloclub.gatech.edu).   

I have collaborated with designers, developers, and scientists at ![](https://mphute.github.io/images/intellabs.svg) Intel Labs, ![](https://mphute.github.io/images/ntu.svg) Nanyang Technological University, and ![](https://mphute.github.io/images/dassault_logo_small.svg) Dassault Systems.

Hey! Hey hey! I'm with you, right? 
C'mon! 
Tommy? Don't dunk me... 
Hayes Landing reports conditions good, with stripers and jacks. The Coast Guard has no storm warning from Block Island to Cape Hatteras; a light chop with freshening winds, continued clear and mild... 
How come the sun didn't used to shine in here? 
'cause when we bought the house it was Autumn. This is summer. Feed the dogs. 
Right. 
Do you see the kids? 
Probably out in the back yard. 
In Amity, you say 'Yahd.' 
The kids are in the yahd, playing near the cah. How's that sound? 
Like you're from N'Yawk. 
Give me 30 years, I'll get it. 
Did you burn another kettle? Y'know you're a fire hazard? This is the third one! 
I never hear the whistle. 
Feed the dogs. 
You want to go through those? I'm taking them to the Thrift Shop. It's Marcia Vaughn's pet charity. Pick out what you want to keep -- it's mostly your city clothes. 
I used to wear this to the Garden. Garbage strikes. Dog shit. Muggers. Ship it. 
Don't be silly - You're going to make summer better for them... 
Cut my hand. Hit by a vampire. 
On the swing? I told you not to play near there until I sanded it down. See what your son did? 
Go upstairs and bring Mommy a band- aid. 
Don't forget these. 
Oh, yeah. How do I look? Older, huh? 
I think they make you look sexy. 
Sexy, hm? What was I before? 
Older, sillier. 
I don't want to depend on these things, y'know - sometimes you can weaken your eyes. 
Let's see... 
Brody... yeah, what's up... mmm... Well, what do they usually do, float or wash up? Really?... okay, I'll meet both of you at the beach in ...20 minutes, okay? Okay. First goddamn weekend of the summer. 
There. What was that? 
The office. 
Be careful. 
Here? You gotta be kiddin'. 
Love ya. 
Hey Chief. Bring my cup back. 
Christine what? 
Worthingsly... Worthington -- no one ever died on me before. 
You picked her up on the ferry. 
I didn't know her. 
And nobody else saw her in the water? 
Somebody could've -- I was sort of passed out. 
Think she might've run out on you? 
Oh, no, sir. I've never had a woman do that. I'm sure she drowned. 
You from around here? 
No. Cambridge. Harvard. My family's in Tuxedo, New York, though. 
You here for the summer? 
Some friends and me took a house. 
What d'you pay for a place just for the summer? 
A thousand apiece, something like that. There's five of us. And we each kick in a hundred a week for beer and cleaning, stuff like that. 
Pretty stiff. 
Maybe that's your girl. 
You can't make me look -- ! 
If this is going to work, you've got to keep current stuff out here, and put 'closed' files in there. The 'Pendings' stay on my desk, okay? 
This is in no order of importance, Chief: There's a meeting on the Amity Town Council on Aging this Monday night, Bentoncourt Hall. The Fire Inspector wants you to go over the fireworks site with him before he catches the one o'clock ferry. Mainly, you have a batch of calls about that new Karate school. 
Searle's Rent-a-Bike, the Rainy Ale, Tisberry's Hardware... they say it's those nine-year-olds from the school practicing karate on all those nice picket fences. 
It's the Coroner. Somebody pass away in the night? 
Jesus, Santos. 
What's the matter? 
Polly, I want to know what water recreation is on for today. 
Right this minute? 
Where'd you hide the 'Beach Closed' signs? 
We never had any. What's the problem? 
Glad I caught you. There's a city truck with New Hampshire plates parked right in front of my... 
Wait-a-minute. Glasses, right? 
Look at those fences! Little guys about eight to ten years old. And look at this! 
They did that with their bare hands. 
Call me later in the day, okay, Harry? 
Stuff's no good to me in August when the Pilgrims come in June... Go on and help yourself to whatever you need, Chief. Can you work the register? 
Polly told me to tell you there's a scout troop in Avril Bay doing the mile swim for their Merit Badges. I couldn't call them in, there's no phone out there. 
Get out of there  take these back to the office and make up some 'Beach Closed' signs, and let Polly do the printing. 
What's the matter with my printing? 
What have you got there, Lenny? 
We had a shark attack at South Chop this morning, Mayor. Fatal. Gotta batten down the beach. 
Who've you told this to, Lenny? 
I just found out about it -- but there's a bunch of Boy Scouts in the water a coupla miles down the coast from where we found the girl. Avril Bay, thereabouts. Chief went to dry them off. 
Take my car, okay? You come with us, Lenny. 
I've got all these signs here... 
C'mon, it'll give us time to think about what they're going to say. 
Let's go, Robbie. You too, Hofner. Boyle, keep your head up. Alberts, keep kicking... 
Martin! Are you going to shut down the beach on your own authority? 
Do I need any more authority? 
Technically, you need the instruction of a civic ordinance, or a special meeting of the town selectmen... 
That's just going by the book. We're just a little anxious that you're rushing into something serious here. This is your first summer. 
Now tell me something I don't know. 
All I'm saying is that Amity is a summer town -- we need summer dollars, and if they can't swim here, they'll use the beaches at Cape Cod, or Long Island. 
So we should set out a smorgasbord? 
We're not even sure what it was. 
What else could've done that? 
Boat propeller? 
I think, possibly... sure. A boating accident. 
Some weekend tramp accidentally goes swimming too far, she's a little drunk, a fishing boat comes along -- 
Remember when Fred Ganz went scalloping in his BVD's? He was going to swim to New Bedford, he said. 
...and Bill Mayhew almost caught him in his net...? 
Doctor, you're the one who told me what it was! 
I was wrong. We'll have to amend the report. 
We never had that kind of trouble here. 
I don't think you can appreciate the gut reaction people have to these things. 
I was only reacting to what I was told. 
It's all psychological, anyway. You yell 'Barracuda' and everyone says 'huh'. You yell 'Shark' and we've got a panic on our hands. I think we all agree we don't need a panic this close to the 4th of July. 
I can't work in a vacuum. Why don't you make Hendricks Chief? His family's been here since the Puritans -- half this island are his cousins. 
Martin, we hired the best man we could find. 
We need someone who isn't prejudiced by old feuds or family ties, someone who can referee things. 
You have our complete support. 
Now then. We've got a vandalism problem we ought to talk about... 
Hello, Mr. Quint. 
Four spools of Number 12 piano wire, Okay? I ordered them. 
Yessir, right here. What do those fish do, eat this stuff? 
They choke on it. 
Bye now. 
Looks like another big season. Gets worse every year. 
And none of them from the Island. Just a lot of bother. 
What? 
Present company excepted, but off- islanders are a pain in the butt. Pardon my French. 
What about this kid? What if he were born here. That make him an islander? 
Just 'cause a cat has kittens in an oven, it don't make them muffins. 
I'm not a muffin! I'm a boy! 
Alex! Alex Kintner! Where do you think you're going? 
Water. Just once more, please? 
Let me see your fingers -- 
They're beginning to prune. 10 minutes more. 
Do you want the boys to come in? Honey, if you're worried... 
How's the water? 
Too cold. I'm going in again Labor Day. Hope we get this weather next weekend. 
You're very tight, y'know? Right there. 
Ow. He's gotta be more careful in the water... 
Buster! Hey, Buster! Here boy! He continues to ad lib calling his dog, but there's no answer, no dog in the water. 
Hey, no fair splashing in the eyes! 
Something in the water. Right there! Didn't anyone see it? 
There's blood in the water. 
What is it...? 
Michael! Sean! Out of the water. Everybody out of the water! Michael! Get out! 
Alex! Alex? Alex...! 
Look, I've got to talk to her. This isn't a contest we want the whole country entering. 
I agree. If she's going to advertise, I wouldn't recommend out-of-town papers. Amity people could take care of this. 
I'm responsible for public safety around here... 
Then go out tomorrow and make sure no one gets hurt. Everybody, could I have your attention? Since this affects all of us, I suggest we move into council chambers, where there's more room... 
Well, here we all are; anyone have any special questions? 
Is that $3000 bounty on the shark in cash or check? 
That's private business between you brave fishermen and Mrs. Kintner. -- Chief -- 
I'd like to tell you what we're doing so far. These are some of the steps I've taken as Chief of Police... 
What's going on with the beaches, Chief? 
I'll get to that in a minute. First, I plan to start our seasonal summer help early, and to use shark spotters on beaches open to the sea. I'd like cooperation from local fishermen, and I've also contacted the Oceanographic Institute over on the mainland. 
No need to involve outsiders in our business, Martin. 
Are you going to close the beaches? 
Larry and I have also decided to close the beaches for a short time. 
Only 24 hours! 
I didn't agree to that! 
That official business could take all summer! 
Maybe it's better to close. 
We should make sure there is no danger. 
I didn't raise my kids to be some fish's lunch! 
The motel is all I own -- you pull the plug on this town and I go down the drain with it. 
Nobody's seen a shark. 
We'll lose business, we lose taxes, we lose our shirts! 
You all know me. You know what I do for a living. I'll go out and get this bird for you. He's a bad one and it's not like goin' down the pond chasing blue-gills and tommy- cods. This is a fish that can swallow a man whole. A little shakin', a little tenderizing and down ya' go. You gotta get this fellow and get him quick. If you do, it'll bring a lot of tourist business just to see him and you've got your business back on a paying basis. A shark of that size is no pleasure and I value my neck at a hell of a lot more'n 3,000 bucks. I'll find him for three. But I'll kill him for ten. 
The bastard is costing you more'n that every day. Do you wanna stay alive and annee up the ten or play it cheap and be on welfare next winter. I'm gonna kill this thing... just a matter of whether I do it now -- or at the end of summer. 
Thank you very much, Mr. Quint, the Selectmen will take your offer under advisement 
Can you stand something to eat? 
Love a cup of tea. With lemon. 
Mikey loves his birthday present. 
Where is he? 
He's sitting in it. 
Honey. He has it tied up to the jetty with a double-knot. 
Son! -- Out of the water now! 
My boat's neat, dad! 
I want him out of the ocean. 
It's three feet deep, Martin 
Michael! Come inside! 
It's his birthday present, and you closed the beach, Honey. I told him not to go in the water after what happened yesterday. I don't believe he'll ever do it again. 
I told him not to go out until he memorized the handbook and the safety safety regulations, until he was sure of himself... 
You heard your father! Out right now! 
You wanna call it a night after here? 
It's only two-thirty. What, are you tired? 
Yeah, Charlie, I got my second wind three nibbles back. 
Leg of lamb this time? 
Screw lamb -- let's shoot the sirloin! 
We're blowin' half the bounty on bait -- 
One more after this, then I'm going home. 
Set? 
Tide's taking it right out. 
You do this all the time, right, Charlie? 
Twenty years. 
I can't believe that people pay money to go fishing. This is really dumb. This isn't even relaxing... it's just boring. 
Hey! What's this? 
Look at him take it! 
Do I set the goddam hook? 
Let him do it! Go-go-go-go-go! 
CHARLIE! JUMP! 
Holy Jesus Christ! 
Get the hell out! Charlie! Swim! 
...So then Denherder and Charlie sat there trying to catch their breath, and figuring out how to explain to Charlie's wife what happened to her freezer full of meat. 
That wasn't funny. 
Mrs. Kintner must've put her ad in Field and Stream. 
Looks more like the readers of the National Enquirer. 
You're charging me double the usual rent! I didn't come up here all the way from New Rochelle to be gouged by some Yankee Cracker! 
Prices go up June First every year. You want a nice cheap, leaky boat, you go down to the Hamptons. Right, Chief? 
Hey! You know how many men that's supposed to hold? 
Whatever's safe, right? 
What you got ain't safe. You take some guys off or you don't go out. 
Hello. 
Hello, back. 
You going out too, Ben? 
Might give it a try. That three thousand bounty beats working for a living. We ready? 
Just back up! No, the other way! Cut it to your left! Your other left! The big boat, your front end is out way too far. Little boat, stay still! 
Ahoy, sail! You got an oar? Well, scull it out! 
Tell that stinkpotter to belay! 
Tell that ragsetter I'm going to poke him in the snoot! 
Just cast off in turn and make for the channel, OK? 
Thanks. 
Excuse me, I wonder if you could tell me... 
Is that dynamite? 
If that's dynamite, give it here, or don't leave port. 
Aw, c'mon, it's just fireworks. Sharks like fireworks, it attracts them. 
Hand it over. 
There's a fantail launch out there that won't make it beyond the breakwater. 
You're tellin' me. I swear, this town has gone crazy. 
Officer, I wonder if you could tell me where I could find Chief Brody? 
Who are you? 
Hooper, Matt Hooper. From the Oceanographic Institute. 
Well, get over there! He ain't caught it yet! 
Hand me that pole! Quick! 
Beat it! I hooked him! 
How's the family, Harry? Go on and do it! 
We split down the middle? 
Let go my shark! 
Let's show Mr. Hooper our accident. 
Victim One, identified as Christine Watkins, female Caucasian... 
...height and weight may only be estimated from partial remains. Torso severed in mid-thorax, eviscerated with no major organs remaining. May I have a drink of water? Right arm severed above the elbow with massive tissue loss from upper musculature. Portions of denuded bone remaining. -- did you notify the coast guard? 
No, it was local jurisdiction. 
Left arm, head, shoulders, sternum and portions of ribcage intact. Please don't smoke. With minor post- mortem lacerations and abrasions. Bite marks indicate typical non-frenzy feeding pattern of large squali, possibly carchaninus lonimanus, or isurus glaucas. Gross tissue loss and post-mortem erosion of bite surfaces prevent detailed analysis; however, teeth and jaws of the attacking squali must be considered above average for these waters. -- Did you go out in a boat and look around? 
No, we just checked the beach... 
It wasn't an 'accident,' it wasn't a boat propeller, or a coral reef, or Jack the Ripper. It was a shark. It was a shark. 
Ginny, get this out on the state wire to AP and UPI in Boston and New York. Have one of them pick it up for the national and call Dave Axelrod in New York and tell him this is from me and he owes me one... let's get a picture. 
Well, if one man can catch a fish in 50 days, then I guess 50 of these bozos can catch a fish in one day -- beginner's luck. 
You did it! Did Ben Gardner catch this? 
Okay, everybody, I want to get a picture for the paper -- could everyone clear out of the way? 
Could you get out of the shot, young man? 
Who, me? Okay... 
Larry, if you'd see these clowns leave, you'd never believe they'd come back with anything. But they got him! 
That's good. That's real good. Ben Meadows getting pictures for the paper. 
Sure he is. 
It's a tiger shark. Very rare in these waters, and definitely a maneater. 
Who's that young man? 
Matt Hooper, the specialist they send down from the Oceanographic Institute. 
I think we all owe a debt of gratitude to these men for catching this monster. 
Whadya mean, 'Bite Radius?' What's that? 
Teeth are teeth, right? 
I didn't say this wasn't the shark, I just said I wasn't sure this was the one... 
What d'ya mean? 
There are hundreds of different kinds of sharks; makos, blues, hammerheads, white-tips... any one of them could've attacked. Look -- shark digestion is slow. We could open this one up, and find whatever he's been eating is still inside. 
That's disgusting! This is the largest, meanest, most vicious shark ever landed off Amity Island, and a known maneater! 
Let's just cut him open and see what's inside... 
Why not, Larry? We could get a positive confirmation that way. 
Be reasonable, boys -- this isn't the time or the place to do some kind of half-assed autopsy on a fish. Ben... do you have all the pictures you need? 
Plenty. 
Wait a minute... 
I am not going to stand here and watch this fish cut open and see some kid fall out on the dock. Besides... 
Chief, I'll take responsibility for this. Boys, cut this ugly sonofabitch down before he stinks up the whole island. Harve, tomorrow you and Carl take him out and dump him right in the drink. 
Chief Brody? 
My Alex was a beautiful little boy and you killed him. Did you know that? You knew there was a shark out there. You knew a girl got killed here last week. I just found that out. But you knew. You knew it was dangerous, but you let people go swimming anyway. You knew all those things, and still my boy is dead now and there's nothing you can do about that. My boy is dead. I wanted you to know that. 
I'm sorry, Martin. She's in a sick, terrible state. 
Look, maybe this is the wrong time to pursue this, but I'm not sure... 
She's right. 
Let's all get out of here, this place stinks. 
I'm going home. 
C'mere and give Daddy a kiss. 
Why? 
Because he needs it. 
Martin Brody residence? 
Hi. I'm Matt Hooper. If your husband is here, I'd like to talk to him. 
So would I. Come on in. 
Would you like something? Some coffee? 
Is anyone having this...? 
Dynamite! How was your day...? 
Swell. 
Here... one red, one white. 
Ummm. Really good. 
My husband tells me you're in sharks. 
I wouldn't put it that way. But I love sharks. 
You love sharks? 
I do. But you've still got a problem here, there's a shark just off the island somewhere. 
How come you have to tell them that? 
Excuse me, but what are you talking about? Didn't they catch the shark this afternoon? It was on the Cape station news. 
They caught a shark, not the shark. Big difference. I could've proved it this afternoon, by cutting that one open and examining his stomach contents. Also, his bite was too small. 
I was lucky to find that in town -- it's an estate bottled vintage year... 
We ought to let it breathe... Whatever. 
Let's all have a drink. 
You too, sweetheart... 
Thank you. 
Here's to your husband, the only other rational man on the island. Day after tomorrow, I'll be gone, and he'll be the only one. 
You're leaving? 
Going out on the 'Aurora.' 
Is that a boat? 
Is it! The best-funded research expedition to ever study the shark... around the world in 18 months. 
Like those Cousteau specials on television? I think it's for the kids, but I love them. 
Better than Cousteau, or Compagno with computers, telemetry, Defense Department funding... 
I saw a show with sea otters, and a big turtle... Mikey loved it. Made me promise to get him one. Will you live on the boat? 
Yep. 
Martin hates boats. Hates the water. On the ferry to the mainland, he sits in the car the whole way over. He's got this childhood thing, there's a clinical word for it. 
Drowning. Lemme ask you something. Is it true most attacks take place in three feet of water, around 10 feet from the beach? 
Yeah. Like the kid on your beach. I wish I could've examined that shark they caught... 
Something else. Do most attacks go unreported? 
About half of them. A lot of 'missing swimmers' are really shark victims. 
There's a kind of a lone shark, called, uh... 
Rogue? 
Yeah. Rogue. Picks out an area where there's food and hangs out there as long as the food supply lasts? 
It's called Territoriality. It's a theory. 
And before 1900, when people first starting swimming for recreation, before public bathing and resorts, there were very few shark attacks, cause sharks didn't know what they were missing? 
You could say that. 
Why don't we have one more drink, you and I, and then we go down and cut open that old shark and see for sure what's inside him, or not. 
Can you do that? 
I am Chief of Police. I can do anything I want. You want to come? 
I'm flattered you should ask. 
...And it was Dartmouth Winter weekend, and she was Homecoming Queen, and I was her date; then she got into the fact that her family had more money than my family, and she was right -- her great-grandfather was in mining, and my ancestors were Yankee shipbuilders. So we broke up and I went home with some beatnik from Sarah Lawrence. 
What stinks so bad? 
Our friend, the shark. 
We always had a summer place on the water -- Newport, the Vineyard, so I figured I'd major in something I knew about. Oceanography, marine biology. It was that, or design racing yachts like my older brother. Hmmm. He we go. Up the old alimentary canal. Hold the light. 
We open the abdominal cavity and check the digestive tract. Simple. 
What's that? 
Half a flounder. Hmmm... a burlap bag... a paint can... aha! 
What? What?! 
Just as I thought. He drifted up here with the Gulf Stream, from southern waters. 
How can you tell? 
Florida license plate. 
He ate a car? 
No, but Tiger sharks are the garbage cans of the ocean. They eat anything. But this one didn't eat any people. There's nothing here... 
...Nothing. 
What do we do? 
If you're looking for a shark, you don't look on land. You go out and chum for him. 
Chum? 
Only one sure way to find him -- offer him a little something to eat. Chum -- blood, waste meat, fish, anything. They can sense it miles away. If he's out there, we might be able to get a closer look at him. It's a good time, too. They're night feeders... 
That's the Cape Light -- we're on the stretch where he's feeding, if he's still here. 
What is all this stuff? 
Depth-finder, fathometer, sonar, closed-circuit TV -- fore and aft -- RDF, single side band... And two loose nuts behind the wheel. 
Can you tell from that if a big man- eater is around? 
Sometimes. Look here -- something big, probably a school of mackerel clumped together. And staying right with us. 
Where'd you get all this? 
I Bought it. Both sets of grandparents set up trust funds for me; stocks went up, so I don't have to touch my principal. 
You're at the Institute full time? Or do you have a job? 
It is a job. I'm not fooling around like some amateur. It's my life! 
We gotta get back soon... 
Hey! 
What the hell? 
That's Ben Gardner's boat! It's the Flicka! Ben? Ben! 
What happened? 
I want to check something. Hold my feet. 
Don't they have lifejackets or something? An extra boat? 
They must've hit something. 
He didn't have a dinghy aboard. I'm going down to take a look at his hull. 
Why don't we just tow it in? 
We will. There's something I've got to find out. 
Be careful, for chrissake. 
You all right? 
A White! A Great White, I found a tooth buried in the hull. He must've attacked... I knew it... Gardner's dead in there. I didn't see the mate... 
No shark did that to a boat! 
Jesus Christ! A Great White! Who'd believe it! We're not talking about a shark, we're talking about a Shark! 
There is a kind of shark called a Great White Shark that every expert in the world agrees is a maneater. 
You're situation here suggests that a Great White has staked out a claim in the waters around Amity Island, and that he will continue to feed here as long as there is food in the water. 
There's no limits to where he can strike, and we've had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days. It happened like this before, in 1916, when a Great White killed five swimmers at Jones Beach, in Long Island. 
A shark's attack is stimulated by the kind of splashing and activity that occurs whenever humans go swimming -- you can't avoid it! 
A 4th of July beach is like ringing a dinner bell, for Chrissake! 
I just pulled a shark tooth the size of a shot glass out of the hull of a wrecked boat out there. 
We towed Ben Gardner's boat in, Larry; he was dead and his boat was all chewed up. 
Is that tooth here? Did anyone see it? 
I don't have it. 
He lost it on the way up. 
What kind of a shark did you say it was? 
Carcaradon carcharias. A Great White. 
Well, I'm not going to commit economic suicide on that flimsy evidence. We depend on the summer people for our lives, and if our beaches are closed, then we're all finished. 
We have got to close the beaches. We have got to get someone to kill the shark, we need non-corrosive mesh netting, we need scientific support... It's gonna cost money just to keep the nuts out and save what we have. 
I don't thing either of you is familiar with our problems... 
I'm familiar with the fact that you are going to ignore this thing until it swims up and bites you on the ass! There are only two ways to solve this thing: you can kill it, or you can cut off its food supply... 
That means closing the beaches. 
Come here, I want to show you something. 
Sick vandalism! Brody, that's a deliberate mutilation of a public service message! I want those little paint-happy bastards caught and hung up by their baby Buster Browns! 
That's it! I'm standing here arguing with a guy who can't wait to be a hot lunch. Goodbye. 
Wait a minute! I need you. 
Out there is a Perfect Engine, an Eating Machine that is a miracle of evolution -- it swims and eats and that's all. Look at that! Those proportions are correct. I know sharks. 
You'd love to prove that. Getting your name in the National Geographic. 
Larry, we can re-open the beaches in August. 
August! Tomorrow is the 4th of July, and we are going to open for business. It's going to be our best summer in years. If you're so concerned about the beaches, you two, you do whatever you have to to keep them safe, but with you or without you, the beaches stay open this weekend. 
Martin Brody? I'll need your signature here... here... and here. 
What is this? 
Authorization for direct payment of flight expenses not directly connected to a normal mission of this command. You pay for the gas. 
I signed on the wrong line... 
Just erase your signature and initial your erasure. 
I want to thank you guys from local agencies for cooperating, and I hope we won't actually be needing your services. But I'm glad to have you here. 
I want to get our lines and repellent out, so we better shove off. 
We're all on one channel, so let's keep radio traffic to a minimum, okay? 
I hope we get some more help. 
I wish it would rain... 
Put 1 on the line. In five. 4. 3. 2. 1. Roll. 
...and with me is the Mayor of Amity, Lawrence Vaughn. Mr. Vaughn, how about those rumors? 
How about them indeed. I'm pleased and happy to repeat the news that we have, in fact, caught and killed a large predator that supposedly injured some bathers here. As you can see, it's a beautiful day, the beaches are open, and the folks here are having a wonderful time. Amity, y'know, means 'Friendship.' 
Also here today is a Marine Biologist and Research Fellow from the Oceanographic Institute, Matthew Hooper. Mr. Hooper, what've you heard? 
What I've heard and what I've seen are two different things. I believe there is a large Great White Shark -- Carcharodon Cacharias - in the waters off this very beach, that he has killed and that he will kill again... 
And there you have it -- two different opinions, by men of good will. The holiday crowd here at Amity seems to be making up its own mind... 
I'm sorry, I just don't have the time. 
Recue the machines. 2, pan off the Chief and show me some tits and ass. 1, get me some cute kids. 3... see if you got a shot at the water. 
Mayor, 43 seconds, Biologist 45 seconds. That's equal time, right? 
Right. Jerry, come on in and look at this. Roll 2. In five, 4. 3. 2. 1. 
Amity Island is famed for its clear air and white sand beaches. But a cloud appeared... 
Look at that shine on my nose. It's a beacon. 
Close enough for remote. 
...I'm pleased and happy... 
Think we ought to stick around? 
What else you got? 
Teachers' strike downtown. 
Christenson, this is Al. Union says time for Engineering Five. 
That's five minutes, guys. Coffee. 
Why don't you get in the water? 
I don't want to wash off my suntan lotion. I'll get a burn... 
Nobody's going in! 
Is there nobody going in? What a shame. Arthur, should I be going in? 
If you'd like. 
It's very nice. Not too cold... Quite refreshing... Very pleasant.... 
No sharks, m'lady. 
This is marvelous! Arthur, I want to come back to this very spot. Will you make a note of where we are? 
Anything? Thought I saw a shadow. Over. 
Nothing from up here, Daisy. Over. 
False alarm. Must be this glare. 
Who's scared to go in! I was in! Up to your knees, yeah -- So come with me -- I'll go again. 
Beautiful day, Chief! 
Hey Mikey -- ! 
You're not going to the ocean with that, are you son? 
I'm all checked out for light surf and look at it. 
Do me this favor just once. Use the ponds. 
Dad, the ponds are for old ladies. 
Just a favor for your old man. 
Sure, Dad. 
Copter to Daisy! Red Four, Red Four! 
Where -- ? 
Went under your -- There! 
Jesus Christ -- Shark! 
Everybody out! Out of the water, please -- leave the water, please -- 
No whistles! No whistles! 
Why did we wrap? Get that! Somebody get that! 
It's no good. I'm dead... 
Block the estuary! The estuary! 
He's in shock. Get blankets! 
The doctor said it's okay -- mild shock. He can come home in the morning. 
Hey, big guy -- you want anything from home? 
My cars. And a comic book. 
Here -- Take him home. 
Home... New York? 
No. Home here. 
Got a pen on you? 
Why? 
There's only one thing you're good for anymore -- signing a damn voucher. Here. It's an authorization to employ a contractor. 
I don't know if I can do that without a... 
I'm going to hire Quint to kill the fish. I want to see that shark dead. 
Maybe we can save August... 
Forget it. This summer's had it. Next summer's had it. You're the mayor of Shark City. You wanted to keep the beaches open. What happens when the town finds out about that? 
I was acting in the town's best interests... 
The best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly-up in the water with a hole in his head. You do the right thing. You authorize me. Right there. Whatever it costs. 
My kids were on that beach... 
Just sign it, Larry. 
This has got to be one big violation... 
This is quite a place. 
Keep your hands off my stuff. 
Did you bring a check? 
What? 
Cash? Or do we do this on a handshake and a promise? 
I'm authorized by the township of Amity to hire you as an independent contractor. We'll meet your price. $10,000. 
And my regular daily rate -- $200, whether we catch him or not. 
You got it. 
And incidental damages, if any... 
You got it. 
And you get the Mayor off my back with this zoning crap. Nobody tells me how to run my property. 
You got it. 
And, uh, a case of apricot brandy and you buy the lunch. 
Two cases. And dinner when you land. 
Try some of this. I made it myself. 
Here's to swimmin' with bowlegged women. 
Mr. Quint... 
I'm not goin'. No sir. 
You want to get paid, you go. 
Forget the money. You can't pay me enough. I ain't crazy. I worked some big mean fish with you, but I ain't goin' on this one. 
This is the last time I hear from you. I don't want anyone with piss for blood on my vessel. Put that blackfish on board, pump the bilges, and top off the fuel tanks, and finish up in the morning. Then you're on the beach. 
You're going to need an extra hand... 
This is Matt Hooper... 
I know who he is... 
He's from the Oceanographic Institute. 
I've been to sea since I was 12. I've crewed three Trans-pacs -- 
Transplants? 
-- and an America's Cup Trials... 
I'm not talking about day sailing or pleasure boating. I'm talking about working for a living. Sharking. 
And I'm not talking about hooking some poor dogfish or sand shark. I'm talking about a Great White. 
Are you now. I know about porkers in the water -- Here. Tie me a sheepshank. 
I don't need to pass basic seamanship. 
Let me see your hands... 
Ha. City hands. You been counting money. If you had a $5000 net and $2000 worth of fish in it, and along comes Mr. White, and makes it look like a kiddy scissors class has gone to work on it and made paper dolls. If you'd ever worked for a living, you'd know what that means. 
Look, I don't need to hear any of this working class hero crap. Some party boat skipper who's killed a few sharks... 
Hey. Knock it off. I don't want to have to listen to this while we're out there... 
What do you mean 'We...?' 
It's my charter. My party. 
All right, Commissioner. But when we're on my ship, I am Master, Mate and Pilot. And I want him... ...along for ballast. 
You got it. 
5 lengths of 1/2-inch, 20 number 14's, straight gaff, flying gaffs, tail rope, eye splice, M-1, 20 clips, pliers, irons... 
Powerhead, CO2 darts, hypo, regulator, tanks, depth gauge, camera, extra magazines, cage... 
You got everything you asked for? 
All of it. And thank Dr. Miro for me. And tell Borack I'll catch up with them in New Zealand. 
This is actually a killing expedition? 
An eye for an eye, you know. 
Hey, Squirt! You want to stow this gear or you want me to use it for ballast? It ain't good for much but bait. 
I'll see ya. Tell Dorothy hello. 
Hello, Junior. What are you? Some kind of half-assed astronaut? Jesus Christ, when I was a kid, every little squirt wanted to be a harpooner or a sword fisherman. What d'ya have there -- a portable shower? 
Anti-Shark cage. 
Who's inside, you or the shark? 
You're in the cage? The cage is in the water? The shark is in the water too? You're in the water with the shark. 
Comin' aboard... 
Did you take your dramamine? Here. 
Hurry up, Chief, daylight's a wastin'. 
Is that him? 
Colorful, isn't he? 
You going to be all right? 
Nothing to worry about -- I'll survive this. 
I'll see you back soon. There's an extra pair of glasses in your black socks, and there's some suntan lotion and blistex in your kit. 
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum. 
What'll I tell the kids? 
Tell 'em I went fishin'! 
Cast off the bow line! Now your stern! 
Front-Bow, Back-Stern, Port, Starboard. Aloft, Below. It's not a staircase, it's a ladder, it's not a rope, it's a line, and if you don't get it right... I'll throw your ass through that little round window. 
Now hear this. You're aboard the fishing vessel 'Orca,' and I'm her Captain, Master, Mate, and Owner. You'll jump when I holler. We're doin' a job here, and Christ, I ain't got time to watch you birds get hooks in your ass and fall overboard. Ship with me, and you'll do all right. Cross me, and I'll slap you upside your heads. Now -- if you boys are ready -- let's go fishin'. 
Here's something for you... 
These greedy sons-a-bitches will eat their own guts. 
Go ahead, you cannibals. Tell 'em where you got it! 
What's that supposed to prove? 
Just a little appetizer. I want our porker to know we're serving. I want to put some iron into that big yap... 
Keep that chum line going -- we've got five good miles. Don't break it. 
Who's driving the boat? 
Nobody. We're drifting with the current. 
Nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing. 
Hell, in the old days we went out with good charts, good sounding lead, and a damn good compass. Nowadays, these kids are afraid to go out without depth finders, radar, radio, electric toothbrush, every stupid thing... 
Get a fresh barrel. 
Watch it! Compressed air -- you screw around with one of those and Boom! Careful, huh? 
Real fine stuff but it won't mean a thing to Mr. Whitey, of course... he didn't go to schools in electronics. He was born with what he does best. Eat. He's a swimming appetite. 'Course he might eat this stuff, but then I've seen him eat a rocking chair, too. Next time, ask me. 
That's pilot whale, isn't it? 
It ain't a Big Mac. The expert don't approve. What do you thing? You're closer to the situation. 
Why are we way out here, when the shark's back there? 
...'cause this is where he lives. You gotta think like they do. 
Easy for you -- they got a brain the size of a radish. 
Now if he weren't around, we'd of hooked something else by now, wouldn't we? But he scared 'em all away. Big lonesome son of a bitch... 
-- he'll gulp it down now... Hooooooo! 
You got it? 
Get behind me, dummy! Reverse her and turn -- he's taking too much line! Wet my reel, quick! 
Starboard, for Chris'sake -- 
Hey, you! Farmer! Half-speed there... 
Aye, Aye SIR. Stand by to repel boarders. Poop the mainsail. Argh, Jim Boy. 
Neutral! Where the hell is he going? 
Oh, this ain't foolin' me -- Sure -- try it! 
Makin' believe it's easy now. 
Gettin' ready to run again -- no? No? What's he playin' here? Put the gloves on! Let's see who's gonna tease who now! 
Let it go, don't waste your time. 
Down here, Hooper! 
I don't know what it is, but it's not a shark. 
Look -- you may be a big Yahoo in the lab, but out here you're just supercargo, and you'll do as I say, or you can take your gear and backstroke home. Now get down here! 
The wire's showing! 
Unbuckle me -- fast! Grab the leader. He ain't normal, this one... they never -- 
It's too wild, too erratic. It's a marlin or a stingray. It's a gamefish. 
Watch your hands -- Grab onto this! 
A marlin, or a stingray. Huh. Don't ever tell me my business again. Get back up on the bridge. 
I'm okay... 
Fasten the pole. 
What's the point with hooks and Lines? -- 
Don't tell me my business! Quarter-mile, that way. Full throttle. 
How -- if they're gonna keep on breaking? 
What I do is trick him to the surface, got that? Then I can jab him, understand? Think I'm gonna haul it in as if he's a catfish, like everyone else does? 
Over there! 
What do you see? 
At least you handle the boat all right. Stop. Here... Cut the engine. 
20 feet, if it's an inch... 
25 feet. And three tons of him there. 
I never saw one that big. 
What do we do? Get some help? Radio in? 
How're we gonna handle this? 
There's a formula! Girth, about 150 inches, squared, divide by 800 -- son of a bitch, they are not going to believe this! -- divide by 2000... three tons! You're right, you old fart! Three tons! 
Amity Point Light Station to Orca. This is Amity Point Light Station, to Orca... 
Orca here. 
I have Mrs. Martin Brody here... 
Put her on. 
...push this? Oh. It's working. Hello, Martin? 
This is Quint, Missus. 
I just wanted to know if you were all right... the Coast Guard let me use their radio. Is Chief Brody there? 
He's busy. 
Well... is everything all right? 
Just fine, Missus. We'll be back soon. Everything's fine. We haven't seen anything yet. Orca out. 
Damn it! I need something in the foreground to give it some scale. Martin! Stand here! No, to your left! 
Here. Rig this to the forward keg up there. 
Get up there and steer her. Follow my hand, and hold 'er steady. I've got to get a clean shot at that porker's head. 
Hurry up, rig the line! 
Come to port. Watch my hand. Steady now... 
The line, man, the line! 
Get clear, damn you! 
Clear! 
Jesus H. Christ On a Crutch! 
Now you've done it, you piss-ant. Stop and rig a goddam tinker toy to my gear. Let the bastard fight the keg for a while. He can't stay down with that on. 
Rig another keg! I'm bringing her around! 
God damn it! We had him! I'm coming about! 
Why don't we go in? Get another crack at him tomorrow. 
We got a barrel on him. We can't lose him. We stay out here until we find him. 
Let's call in -- we can radio and have a big boat here in an hour... 
You hired me, remember? It's my $10,000. It's my shark... 
He's up again. 
That's not so bad. Look at this: ...St. Paddy's Day in Knocko Nolans, in Boston, where some sunovabitch winged me upside the head with a spittoon. 
Look here. Steve Kaplan bit me during recess. 
Wire burn. Trying to stop a backstay from taking my head off. 
Moray Eel. Bit right through a wet suit. 
Face and head scars come from amateur amusements in the bar room. This love line here... ...that's from some crazy Frenchie come after me with a knife. I caught him with a good right hand right in the snot locker and laid him amongst the sweetpeas. 
Ever see one like this? 
Bull shark scraped me while I was taking samples... 
Nothing! A pleasure scar. Look here -- 
Slammed with a thresher's tail. Look just like somebody caressed me with a nutmeg grater... 
I'll drink to your leg. 
And I'll drink to yours. 
Wait a minute, young fella. Look. Just look. Don't touch... 
...Mako. Fell out of the tail rope and onto the deck. You don't get bitten by one of those bastards but twice -- your first and your last. 
I think I can top that, Mister... 
Gimme a hand, here. I got something to show you -- 
There. Right there. Mary Ellen Moffit broke my heart. Let's drink to Mary Ellen. 
And here's to the ladies. And here's to their sisters; I'd rather one Miss than a shipload of Misters. 
Look a' that -- Bayonet Iwo Jima. 
C'mon. Middle appendix -- 
I almost had 'im. 
What's that one, there? 
Tattoo. Had it taken off. 
Don't tell me -- 'Death Before Dishonor.' 'Mother.' 'Semper Fi.' Uhhh... 'Don't Tread on Me.' C'mon -- what? 
'U.S.S Indianapolis.' 1944. 
What's that, a ship? 
You were on the Indianapolis? In '45? Jesus... 
as the tip of a fine-pointed drill bores into the amber toward the trapped bug. Orange flecks fly. The mosquito trembles. The drill continues, stopping just before it touches the tiny body. 
PANORAMA of a dinosaur dig, a major excavation filled with workers shoveling earth and stone, making measurements, taking photographs, scribbling notes, and conferring with each other. 
Right calcaneus of an adult female raptor. Mild stress fractures. What's this tell me? 
It tells me that this bone connects to the navicula which we already found articulating to the cuboid. 
Dr. Sattler! Dr. Grant is thinking! 
So, what can we stay for sure? Stress fractures in the heel ... 
She jumps. 
Right as rain, Ellie. Now, why did she jump? 
A defensive posture against a vicious, blood-thirsty T-Rex? 
Perhaps. Or maybe to select the smaller, more tender leaves in the higher branches with which to suckle her young? 
I bet is was a mating ritual. 
The science of paleontology can't answer these questions. Novelists and artists who dream a vision of the Jurassic period can attempt these questions with their imaginations. What we scientists can say is considering the mass and kinetic articulation of these bones, this animal had a vertical leap of about twelve feet. Not as entertaining as fiction, but absolutely fact without prejudice. 
Excuse me, Dr. Grant. But ... fact is, we're late. There's the car. 
Jim, you keep making up the plaster batches. Whatever ratio you're using, it's perfect. Nora, no digging after five - when the temperature drops, those bones are just too brittle. Bill, I don't want any tourists walking over my raptor - I don't care if the Governor of Montana is with them, just you guys. 
You know, if ev ery scientist stuck to his method like you, there would be no body of theory - no quasars, no big bang - 
Jesus, a limousine. We're re-entering Hammond's world, that's for sure. Remind me why we're doing this, Ellie. 
We're leaving the raptor dig - 
- at a critical time - 
- because Gennaro is paying us sixty thousand dollars to observe some resort of Hammond's in Costa Rica. And that's - 
- enough money to keep us free of commercial affiliations for two summers. All right, all right. Good. 
Financial independence for fraternizing with the enemy? I'll do it. 
This is all could come up with, Skip? 
Wise guy. Let's go, Ellie. 
Five hundred thousand is peanuts! 
I'm not reneging. I'm re-evaluating. 
You think I'm a scumbag, I know. 
Look pal, you make a career in biogenetic industrial espionage, and you're bound to run across a scumbag or two. Guaranteed! Part of the job description. Look, who's to say, who is the real scumbag? After all, I know what you guys need so bad. I've heard of reverse engineering. 
Let the other guy put in all the work, all the R and D. You take the finished product, work backwards, breaking it down to reveal its genetic code. Presto! In a few measly months you have know-how that took researchers ten years to determine. You know how much Hammond has invested of his own personal wealth? Over five billion dollars! And if you guys get the jump on his - in no time, the market's wide-open. 
But, boy, he's really got his product! Oh yes siree, massive, gargantuan, money- making, never-heard-of-profit-like-that product. It is a sight! Yes, indeedy! 
Scumbag. We have a deal. That deal is not open to renegotiation. Or even re- evaluation. 
The deal stands. Take it or leave it. 
I'll give you a few minutes to decide. 
Make sure the eggs are on that supply ship. Just make sure! 
We can't trust Hammond anymore. He's under too much pressure. There's the EPA, he's behind schedule, and the in- vestors are getting nervous. There have been too many rumors, too many accidents. We can't screw around with this. 
I've asked Hammond to arrange independent site inspections every week for the next three weeks. 
What does he say? 
Insists nothing's wrong on the island. 
You know him. Do you believe him? 
No, I don't. I spent a lot of time with him five years ago when we raised the capital. And it was a wild ride. He's unpredictable, a dreamer. 
Potentially dangerous. We should never have gotten involved. What's our position? 
The firm owns five percent. 
General or limited? 
General. 
We should have never done that. 
It seemed wise at the time. We all wanted the park to happen. It was in lieu of fees. 
Will they tell the truth? 
I think so. That guy Grant's a hotshot in his field, always goes his own way - 
- Good. You're making all the arrangements? 
Hammond asked to place the calls himself. I think he wants to pretend the park is not in trouble. That it's just a social invitation, showing off the island. 
All right ... Good. But let's be very clear about one thing. I don't know how bad this situation actually is, Donald. But if there's a problem on that island - don't be afraid to screw Hammond and burn Jurassic Park to the ground. 
Costa Rica, my ass. 
That's Isla Nublar. Buckle up, the descent is a little hairy. 
This is exciting! 
What is, Ellie? Where are we going? 
Looks like Alcatraz. 
There's bad wind shear on this peak. 
How the hell is he landing this thing? 
This is not fun. 
Relax, Ellie. I'm sure they wouldn't land if it weren't safe. 
Gennaro? This guy knows what he's doing, Right? Hey, Gennaro? I'm talking to you! 
No problem. Relax, relax. 
Whoa!!!! 
I don't like this feeling ... 
Just think, Gennaro - - you gotta agree it's funny! These two, they dig up dinosaurs! It's wonderful, isn't it? 
Dr. Bones, you're going to love this place. 
Come on folks. Gotta get back, there's a storm alert. 
Hi! Ed Regis. Real big welcome to Isla Nublar, Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler. Little tough landing here, I know. But you did it! Come on down, we're so happy to have you. Now, watch your step. 
This is Robert Muldoon, great African big game hunter. And he's working for us now. Doing a bang-up job, too. 
Ed's a little more BS than PR. Mr. Gennaro, nice to have you back. 
Mr. Regis, what is the nature of this park? 
Aggressive growth, huh? 
Hammond's trademark. 
Out animals are greeting you! 
I hope this isn't one of those animatronic exhibits in a Jurassic botanical setting. 
Nope. 
I hope you brought your bathing suits! Doesn't this mist and these plants really create a bonafide prehistoric feeling? 
There's the Visitor's Center. 
Mr. Hammond is dying to see you guys. 
Hot, hot, hot. Ten billion bucks and the air conditioning sucks. 
The audicity of man to get here at the last second and think he runs the show. 
Please come to the theater. In a moment, our film will begin. 
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to an ancient and mysterious world, a world long before humankind inhabited it with all out remarkable dreams and questions. Enter a world that existed one hundred million years ago. When our changing earth was the abode of magnificent creations. 
- the furious haste to commercialize genetic engineering. 
Biotechnology promises the greatest revolution in human history. It will outdistance atomic power and computers in its effects on our everyday lives. We'll see square trees for easy lumbering and white trout for super visibility to fisherman. Why it will transform every aspect of human life: out medical care, our food, our health, even our very entertainment. 
Here we go. 
... Jurassic Park. What we do here is made possible through the miracle of DNA replication, commonly known as cloning. To explain what cloning means, I'm going to need my own clone - John Hammond. 
Hi, John! 
Hi, John. 
Okay John, hold out your finger. 
Why? 
I need some of your genetic material. 
Now just a minute here, John. 
Your genetic material is the same in every cell of your body. You have a hundred billion cells. You won't miss a couple. 
OW!!! That hurt! Hey, what's - 
John, let's look into your blood, the river of life. There's your white cells, exquisitely evolved to clean up bodily wastes. And there's a mighty nucleus, the heart and brain of a cell. This nucleus has an amazing property. It can sp lit in half and reproduce itself. That's how it grows. And then those two can do it again. And again. Making copy after copy of itself. 
Hi, I'm John Hammond. Hey, I'm John Hammond. No, I am. I am. 
Come on, that's enough of this! And I thought to reproduce myself I had to do it the old-fashioned way. 
That's all we've got so far. A lot of fun, isn't it, Mr. Gennaro? 
You bet! 
It's been a long time, Alan. I know the preceding was not your sort of enter- tainment. Popular science - 
No, I don't mind popular science. I dislike the commercialization of science. It breeds a sloppiness, a disregard for method. 
Well, I don't disregard method. But think of mutation - which is nothing more than sloppy communication on the cellular level. Think how triumphant mutations have been in natural selection. 
Mr. Hammond, the essential truth of a scientific law ha s nothing to do with public reaction. Water freezes at thirty-two degrees, whether you pay for it or not. 
Donald, in bringing my old friend, Alan Grant, you've brought an excellent critic to observe the viability of my island and out venture. I look forward to winning you over, Dr. Grant. 
Just what is it you're trying to clone? 
Grandpa! 
Mr. Hammond, this is a serious investiga- tion of the island, not a weekend excursion or a social outing. We're talking about the safety of this place! 
I'm aware of that. But I built this place for children. You can't investigate it without their reactions. They're what this place is all about. 
My grandchildren. Genetics were kind. They're more like my ex-wife than me. 
Who makes a windows ... smaller? 
I know you. You wrote my book. Lost World of The Dinosaurs. It's awesome. 
Timmy's got dinosaurs on the brain. 
Don't worry - he'll grow out of it. 
Dr. Grant's embarrassed that his book was so widely successful. He wrote if for gra duate students. 
Although Dr. Grant suspects otherwise, this is not an ill-conceived, half-baked, poorly funded plan that I've headed. This is a plan to which I committed all of my personal resources, literally billions of dollars. And Donald Gennaro here has kindly helped me raise that sum again from wealthy Japanese. They love theme parks. I have recruited pre- eminent scientific minds from hallowed universities and we've taken the time to do things right. 
Jurassic Park is the most advanced amusement park in the world. We work with genetics - life's essential building blocks - to create new worlds. I set out to make biological attractions. Living attractions. Attractions so astonishing that they'd capture the imagination of the entire world. 
What exactly do you mean ... biological attractions? 
As you well know, long ago, creatures ten times larger than whales roamed our adolescent Earth. And then mass, mysterious extinction created a time barrier unscalable until ... now. 
Yes? 
Dinosaurs. I've been cloning dinosaurs! 
Ladies and Gentlemen, Jurassic Park. Not a resort, not a scien tific conservatory, just a little piece of pre-history that every child in the whole wide world will insist on visiting. 
At least every rich child. 
Apatosaurs in the lowland. Gallimimus in the grassy plain. Dilophosaurus above the river. The mighty Tyrannosaurus Rex! 238 fabulous creatures so far! 
Real dinosaurs, Grandpa? Don't they want to just kill each other? 
Timmy, there's electric fences and moats and video surveillance at all times. There are monitors every hundred feet whatever we could plant them on the island. A computer to tabulate it all. 
You created dinosaurs? Who gave you the right to do that? 
I didn't create them. I found a way to wake them up, to stir them out of their prehistoric slumber. 
We don't have the science. There's no source of dinosaur DNA. 
Yes ... there is. 
Glitches. 
And this is the right side of my brain. The entire park is safely controlled from here. John Arnold, that genius over there, is the m aster control operator. John, don't smoke so much, you're far too valuable a man to me. 
Oh, you'd survive just fine without me. 
Everything's controlled from here. Remote everything. Cars, feeding programs, medicine dispensers, fecal clean up - and that can be tons in a park like this. We run this place with twenty workers. This computer does it all. And it polices each and every single animal out there. 
Who polices the computer? 
That's where I will watch the astonished watchers. Okay, let's go. 
Thanks for the kind word, Mr. Hammond. 
Come on, Dennis, he knows your technical contributions have made it all possible. 
Right. 
That stuff turns you into a mutant! 
Don't mind the signs. They're only legal precautions. 
My laboratory, Lex. It will be yours and Timmy's someday. 
It's ... gold! 
It's amber. Fossilized tree sap. 
Grandpa found gold. 
You're both right. Amber is our gold. The alpha or our alchemic alphabet. The precious course of our genetic material. You already know amber is the fossilized resin of prehistoric tree sap, of course. 
Imagine - millions of years ago, tree sap flowing over insects, as it does now as I speak, in thousands of forests and backyard trees everywhere. Imagine that ancient sap trapping a little struggling insect and consuming it in a syrupy death. Millions and millions of years pass and we come along and discover this prehistoric insect. If we're lucky, he's perfectly preserved in a fossil form inside the hardened sap which is now amber. And as we examine more and more amber, we find many perished insects, including among them, biting insects - 
Like mosquitos - 
Like mosquitos, precisely, Dr. Grant. 
Mosquitos that sucked the blood of dinosaurs. That's your source of DNA 
The extraction room speaks for itself. 
It does? 
That's a million year old mosquito? 
Put in a piece of amber, find a mosquito, drill it out. Right? 
Right. You are witnessing the extraction of tissue from the thorax of this humble insect. If this mosquito has ingested any foreign red blood cells - say it bit a hadrosaur or a stegosaurus or a T-Rex - we will extract those blood cells and obtain paleo-DNA, the how-to-build instruction book of an extinct creature. So you see, Ellie, I'm not creating dino- saurs. Fossils left behind the information, the map of how to bring them back. I'm helping them escape from the confined of time. 
But even thousands of mosquitos wouldn't give you enough tissue to determine a complete DNA strand. 
Right you are, Dr. Grant! More like hundreds of thousands of mosquitos are necessary to provide even a partial strand of DNA. And without a complete strand, we don't have a dinosaur. 
Ah, I knew you two would hit it off! Dr. Grant, this is Dr. Wu, my chief geneticist. 
Finally, you are here! I've been working without the encouragement of my peers for too long. Welcome, welcome! 
Mr. Hammond never lets me publish and he's interested only in results, not in science. 
Don't forget to thank me when you pick up your Nobel prize. 
You are standing in the middle of the most powerful genetics factory created since the expulsion from Eden. 
These are Hamachi-Hood automated gene sequencers, those are Cray XMP's, supercomputers that take DNA information and organize it. In this room, we take fragmented or incomplete DNA strands and compare them to other incomplete strands. 
It's like finding the missing pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. 
The computers make sever al trillion calculations to provide us with a complete DNA strand - the genetic code of an extinct animal. 
Okay, you have your "complete" DNA strand. How do you grow it? 
We use unfertilized crocodile ova as our breeding medium. 
Our primordial soup. 
And how do you know what it is you're growing? 
Well, we have computer techniques to try and map out finds on an evolutionary basis. But mostly, we just grow it and find out what it is. If it's something we're interested in, and it survives, we keep it. 
And if you're not interested? 
Come look! 
This is the incubation room. We keep the temperature at ninetynine degrees and a relative humidity of one hundred percent. 
Jurassic atmosphere. 
We also run a high oxygen concentration, up to thirty-three percent, so if you feel faint, please tell me right away. 
I'm ... melting! 
Reptile eggs contain large amounts of yolk but no water at all. The embryos must extract water from the surrounding environment. 
That's why you create the mist. 
Children, please do not touch! The eggs are permeable to skin oils. 
What kind of eggs are these? Are these shells plastic? 
Yes, they are, The embryos are mechanically inserted and then hatched in this room. But we've managed to sufficiently mimic the actual biological process - these creatures rupture the plastic membrane that they're contained in when they're born. Like real births. 
Eggs that are determined viable spend their last couple days in our specially- designed incubators, which help accelerate the pre-natal developmental stages. Which is interesting becaus we're having a problem with the adult animals - 
There's no problem Dr. Wu can't handle. Now who wants to see the real thing? 
... so naturally, Hammond's going to present everything in the best light. I need to know that this park is safe. 
I'll tell you something that troubles me from the start. The carnivores are all well-fed and kept separated from their 
How do you mean? 
The carnivores will want to hunt. It's an instinct. And that instinct will have to be satisfied or suppressed. 
Gennaro is putting negative ideas into Ellie's head. He's a naysayer. I have no affection for that type of thinking. 
Don't worry. Ellie makes her own judgments. 
Hey! Great day for a tour! 
Looks like rain to me. 
No! I told the rain-god to hold it off till we got back. 
Kids, mind Mr. Regis. He's in charge now. 
Gennaro, for once in your life, let something really move you. 
Ever get the feeling we're just Hammond's damn guinea pigs? 
I like to wait and see. 
Welcome to Jurassic Park. You are now entering the lost world of the prehistoric past, a world of mighty creatures long gone from the face of the earth, which you are privileged to see for the first time ... 
That's Richard Kiley. We spared no expense. 
We'll begin our tour today with the herbivores ... 
... and the grasses are a species of juniper, and samples can be purchased at the gift shop. Now, if everyone will take a look to the right ... 
Look ... 
I don't see anything. Do you see anything? There's nothing there. 
Something's out there ... 
Ellie! Can you imagine the excavation team seeing this! 
Congratulations. You're the first kids in the whole wide world ever to see real dinosaurs. 
Alan? Alan? He fainted! 
My God, we're going to make a fortune here! 
He fainted. I've waited fifteen years to impress that young man. 
Oh Mr. Hammond, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but Muldoon needs you by the pit. 
Oh, balls. 
... Gallimimus, known as the ostrich dinosaur for the shape of its shoulders, have a very strong nesting instinct ... 
Ellie? What the hell are we going to do with the rest of our lives? 
What to you mean? 
Can't you see it, Ellie? We're the ones that are extinct now. 
... lots more to see in the herbivore section of our park. But as we come alongside out Jurassic jungle river to the left, let's try and catch a glimpse of a very unusual and dangerous carnivore. Look across the river and above ... 
And there they are! 
Dilophosaurus! 
Dilophosaurus is one of the earliest carnivores. Scientists once thought their jaw muscles were too weak to kill, but now, through the miracle of their cloning, we know Dilophosaurs spit venom, a poison which causes blindness and then unconsciousness. 
Poisonous d inosaurs, there's a liability issue without a lot of precedent. 
It's like a Gila monster of a cobra. It's a poison ... 
Spitter! 
Are we dreaming all this? 
These raptors are too damn dangerous. One of them tunneled out this morning. He ripped a boy's arm off before I could get a bullet in him. 
A bullet? Muldoon - no! Now what? I have five left? 
John, they're mean as scorpions and smart as chimps. Their little fingers make them natural cage-breakers. We should terminate the raptor program. They're just too smart. Too damn smart. 
Oh balls. I will not terminate the raptors just because they're behaving normally. They're hunters. Why can't we contain them properly? 
John, remember back in '88, when we started to build the containment devices? 
It's just a zoo, Muldoon. A zoo. Figure out a way to contain them. And we'll sit down and have a nice long discussion about raptors - after my guests leave, okay? 
Okay! Get a 'dozer, start digging round the pit. We're gonna bury some fence. And wear your rifle when you're working! 
Wh ere are they? Punch 'em up. 
They'll be by the trike's in a moment. Trike's sick again. 
How can you say it so matter-of-factly? The trike's. You casually accept it, but I never can. You know what it means when you say "by the trikes"? "By the trike's" means that they're out there by the species: triceratops horridus. It astounds me every time what I've done here. What magic, what alchemy. We turned a piece of a rock into a dinosaur. I will never be complacent about that. 
Don't want to be stuck here if this chop gets much worse. 
Coffee anyone? 
Hello skipper, John Hammond, how are you tonight? I certainly don't want to imperil anyone. But can you give us one more container of food? Then we'll feel comfortable is the storm delays your return. Could you help us out here? Of course, if it looks too choppy just go, but you'd be doing us a big favor. 
Well ... we'll do our best, sir. We'll get one more container off. How's that? 
I feel so sorry for her. She's so sick. 
We don't know what's wrong with Freda. Every six we eks she gets like this. 
Oh, she'll be up and around in no time. After a big night, I feel the same way. 
Poor girl. What's the matter? Ellie, look at this. 
Microvesicles. Interesting. 
Doesn't she have a mommy and a daddy? 
We make these dinosaurs in the lab, sweetheart. But they do form attachments. Freda has a little one that follows her around, thinks Freda's his mom. 
What does sh e eat? Where does she feed? 
Animal this size takes in a minimum of six hundred pounds of plants a day. We truck in hay and meadow grasses seven times a day. That's all she touches. 
West Indian Lilacs! 
These'd give anybody a stomachache. 
I'm telling you, the animals don't eat don't eat that stuff. 
Dr. Grant, sir? How 'bout these? There' s lots of little piles of these? 
Hey, Ellie take a look at his. Good work, Timmy. 
Extremely smooth. Purple stains, could be those lilac berries. 
I don't get it. 
Looks like your trike swallows stones to help her digest her food. Walking around, she crushes berries against the stones. And even just a little crushed berry is eventually enough, 
So, she poisons herself periodically. 
Bet we tested her saliva for any trace of - 
But with th e stones, she swallows them and probably bypasses any mucosal contact. Straight to the stomach. I would test her excrement. 
Yo, yuk! 
Hey Regis, where are your rain gods? It's gonna pour. Let's finish our tour. 
I'm staying. 
Soil samples? 
You read my mind. I think she's sicker then they're saying. Her skin is dry and flaky. And her gums are pale. I'm going to talk to Dr. Wu. 
Good idea. I'll keep my eyes open. 
Jim, what the hell's with you ... I know a storm's coming, I can't ... it's all so tightly planned ... that's not enough ... ok, twenty minutes, I'll be there. Damn! 
The mighty T-Rex arose late in dinosaur history. Dinosaurs ruled the earth for a hundred and twenty million years, but there were tyrannosaurs for only the last fifteen million years of that period ... 
You know, Dr. Grant, Hammond likes to come here in the evening and just sit. 
Where is the T- Rex? 
Good question. 
Maybe she's down hunting apatosaurs. 
Would if she could, believe me. Some- times she stands by the lagoon and stares at those animals, and wiggles those little forearms of hers in frustration. But the T-Rex territory is completely enclosed with trenches and fences. Believe me, she can't go anywhere. 
Then where is she? 
L ROOM - 
Just checking in. Everything ok? 
Look at them. Leaning out the windows, so eager. They can't wait to see it. They have come for the danger. 
That's what I'm afraid of. 
What's going to happen to the goat? Is the T-Rex gonna come eat the goat? 
He's here. 
Looks like the Rex will have its snack a little later today. 
The sensors don't see the Rex around. She usually comes within five minutes of hearing dinner. If she doesn't, that means she's sleeping - we might have access to her at the picnic area. 
I didn't want to see him get eaten. I liked the goat. 
What is a carnivore got out? 
There'd be no stopping it. Huge, with no natural enemies, and a suppressed hunting instinct. 
Damn those people. They are so negative. 
It's natural. They can't fully appreciate that we've engineered the animals and the park for total safety. 
They comb this island like a bunch of accountants. They don't experience the wonder, the awe of it all. 
You can't make people experience wonder. 
It's like the Garden of Eden out there. This is the most beautiful time of day. 
Better rout the tour back. They can start again sun-up tomorrow morning. 
Yup. Call the kitchen. Those kids'll be hungry when they get in. 
Sorry 'bout that. I've taken all the lines to upload some data. 
I'll clear a couple of lines for you at the end of the next transmission, sir. Here you go now, this will make it all better, Mr. Hammond. 
- Nedry's fat finger punching a last key. 
... enjoy a healthy snack. This is also a good time to ... 
Hey, is that bathroom working? 
Sure. Rest stop. 
Is that still the T-Rex paddock? 
Yes. But she never comes here. I don't know why not. Probably too much construction. 
Yup! Looks like a never-ending weekend for me. I'm gonna get a Diet Coke. Don't touch my console, ok? Line will be clear in five minutes. 
Slob! 
Well, at least he knows what he's doing. 
Everything's just fine. It's a temporary glitch due to the rain. No doubt, they're going to re-rout some circuits back at the mainframe. We'll have the power back on in moments. Let's get back in the cruisers, they may start up, and I'd like us all to be seated in them. 
I knew we shouldn't have kids here. 
Mr. Regis, are dinosaurs ... nocturnal? 
No, darling, of course not. 
Mr. Regis? What's ... nocturnal? 
Don't you worry about d inosaurs. They're all very safe in their paddocks just like animals in a big, strong zoo. They're not going anywhere we don't tell them to go. 
Okay, little ones! Here we go! 
What's going on, Arnold? I want those lights on. I don't want my grandchildren scared. 
Jesus, the computer's gone down. 
Well, I want the computer up. This is the wrong weekend for glitches. 
That's not the worst of it. 
Oh yeah? Please tell me what's worse than the lights going out? 
All the security doors are open. Someone has been in my laboratory and the eggs have been disturbed. 
Where the hell is Nedry? Where is he? Did anybody check the damn john? 
John, the generator's shut down. Who cut the power? 
Arnold's on it. You go out and bring back the tour right away. I don't need any of this! 
Oh, shit! 
Get out, get out! I need this jeep. There's a problem with the tour. Ellie, Hammond'll fill you in. 
No! I'm going with you, Muldoon. 
Good. Glad to see you. Were you seen? 
Nah. I'm back in five minutes, they'll never know I was gone. Careful with that thing! It's worth more than the ship. When's the copter meeting you? 
It's not. The storm's coast-to-coast, 
Shit! What's the backup? I don't like this. Maybe we should do it another time, I don't like it. I just don't like - 
Shhh! I wired Baker, he'll have a man at the dock in Puntaremas. We should be able to make that in time. 
Ten hours? 
Yeah, now relax. I got a lot riding on this too, you know. No one's going to mess up now. Baker's not going to mess up. His people won't let him. 
Ok. Ok. Here. 
Look, this is insulating spray. 
In about eight hours, spray down all the eggs with this stuff. It'll keep 'em warm but not too warm. I hope Baker has it together with the dock. 
Hey, these thing work great. I can see in the dark and I can see far. 
Hey! I wonder if that boat's still there? It is. I think they're getting ready to go. 
Timmy, can you give her the goggles? 
Want to look at the boat, Lex? 
Hey, that fat guy's down there. Is he gonna come get us and take us to Grandpa? 
They have one of those things from the room with all the eggs - you know, where they help the baby eggs grow up. 
You mean an incubator? 
What's the commotion? 
Let me see. Give them to men, sweetheart. 
Uh, Dr. Grant? 
We saw that computer guy helping 'em load an incubator onto the ship. 
Yeah, he's stealing them, Dr. Grant! He's stealing my Grandpa's eggs! 
Nedry? With an incubator? Regis?? 
That's what they saw. 
We gotta tell Hammond and Arnold right away. How far is it to the mainland? 
Uh, it's a hundred miles to Puntaremas. About a sixteen hour voyage in this weather. 
I wouldn't like to see dinosaurs running around Costa Rica. 
When's the damn power coming on? 
Strong legs. 
Lot of track in college. 
I'm hungry. When can we get going? 
When the electricity comes back on, honey. These cars run on electric cables buried in the road. 
Must be turning on the electricity. 
Feels like a vibration. 
RS, REST AREA - FIRST CRUISER 
Jesus Christ. 
Bad language. 
Jesus Christ. The fence isn't electrified. 
Is that bad? 
Mr. Regis! Mr. Regis, where are you going? 
He just left us. He just left us all alone. Timmy, Timmy how could he do that? We're all alone! We're all alone! 
Timmy, be quiet. Don't move. 
Holy shit! Any suggestions what we do now? 
Don't move. 
It's too, too dark out there. 
Shut that flashlight, Tim! 
No, it's mine. Please, I need it. 
Are you ok? Be quiet and don't move. 
Lex? Lex? 
Extinct animals should stay extinct! 
CK - 
Dr. Grant! 
Lex, are you okay? 
Timmy's unconscious, he won't move. 
Timmy! 
Let ... go ... please. 
Shit. I'm going to have to change clothes. 
I hope this is one of them herbivores. 
Gross. 
I'm blind, I'm blind. 
Oh shit! 
Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit! 
Timmy. Are you ok? 
Thank God you're here. Where's Lex? 
Below. She's fine. Let's get you down. 
Try the door you're leaning against. Nice and slow. 
Crawl this way. Slowly. 
We're going to have to make a jump for it, Timmy. Okay? 
One, two, three, jump. 
Thanks, Dr. Grant. 
You owe me one. 
Where'd Lex go? 
There's Lex. 
Come on out now, Lex. 
It's your turn to wear the goggles, Lex. 
I found your baseball. 
You did? 
Cone on, Lex, it must be cold in there. And tight. Why don't you come out? 
I'm afraid of the "animals". 
The "animals" are gone. 
Where did it go? 
I don't kno w but it's not here now. 
Are there any grownups out there? 
I'm a grownup, Lex. Come on out. Gimmie you hand, come on, here you go. 
I'm hungry. 
Me, too. We've got to get ourselves back to civilization. 
Noooooo! 
What's going on? 
It's Regis and the Rex is after him. But it's okay. Regis knows the Rex can't see him. Evidently, he can only see move- ment. Regis'll be ok if he stays still. 
Let's go! 
Oh, My God! Where's the other one? 
Ellie! 
Wait up. 
T-Rex tracks. 
Then they must be out there. They must be out there. I know it. 
Perhaps. 
No! They're out there. 
I've seen a lot of animal attacks in the bush. It's not as gory and horrifying to see as you'd think. No pools of blood or exposed bones. There is usually little or no evidence left behind. And if victims are small, a predator can kill by just shaking the little thing to death, eating it, and leave not so much as a button. 
Thank God. We have to carry him. First I have to ... 
He's losing a lot of blood. Help me. 
Looks like you've been through this before. 
I told you I've seen big game attacks in Africa. 
Right. 
Why? 
Because Nedry messed with the code. That's why I'm checking it. 
But that could take weeks. What would be faster? Try keychecks. 
That's true. Keychecks will give me a record of every button Nedry pushed. 
Jesus, that's all he did all afternoon? He was just dicking around, maybe waiting to get his nerve up. 
What's that? 
Some sort of object. Let's see if we can trace it. 
ETER FENCES OFF/ SECURITY - INTERIOR FENCES OFF/ SECURITY - LABORATORY DOORS OFF/, etc. 
What's it mean? 
It wasn't a bug. It was a trap door that fat bastard left for himself. When he hit WHTE-RBT. OBJ, it initiates a set of commands that turned the whole goddamn park off. Hammond was right about him. 
If I did that I'd leave a way to turn it back on. In case I had to. I'm sure Nedry did. You're find it. 
We found Gennaro. He'd badly injured. Harding's tending to him in your quarters. He'll be all right if we can 
I'm sure you'll find them. 
I certainly hope so. 
I'm sure we will. After all, I keep telling everyone, this park is made for children. 
Just so you understand that they're missing, sir. 
Missing? Of course I know they're missing. You just said that. Look, Bob, let's not get carried away. We've had a little breakdown from the storm or whatever, and as a result we've had a regrettable, unfortunate accident. And that's all that happened. We're dealing with it. Arnold will get the computers cleaned up, and the radio and phone lines open. You'll find those kids and my good friend, Dr. Grant. I'm sure they'll want some of this ice cream. It's very good. 
That Rex didn't even give me his full attention. That's what hurts. I was just an afterthought. I gave him my full attention. 
He's had a lot of morphine. 
Not enough. 
I need to find Wu. I have to run a few tests in his lab. 
He's probably in the control room, get- ting in the way while Arnold tries to put things together. 
Yo ho, I'll close this place down ... 
I'm tired. 
You're too big to be carried. 
But I'm tired-tired. 
Okay, Lex. 
Oof! You're heavy. 
I think we're still in his paddock. 
What? 
Don't you see? Don't you see? 
What? 
The fence. 
No. 
Oh I do, right there! 
Timmy's scared of heights. 
Shut up. 
Okay with the fence, Timmy? 
'Fraid of heights. 
A herbivore grazing area. Excellent. 
We gonna walk all night? 
Twelve hours before that ship reaches the mainland. 
We need sleep. 
Up there. 
Climb? Again? I can't climb again? 
Sure you can. 
It's ok, Lex. Everything's gonna be okay. 
What is taking Arnold so long? This room is too cold. My eggs will be damaged. 
No sign of those berries. Really interesting. There are indications of a similar virus in every tissue sample. But it's not in the ground. Could I look at some of the discarded embryos? 
I'm sure you'll find your virus ... or a similar one. All animals carry many viruses in a dormant condition. It's almost impossible to say with certainty which are the same strains. 
And yet from what Harding tells me, many of you animals have similar symptoms - besides the microvesicles, a lack of hunger, loss of reproductive urges, sores in the mouth and gums. 
What the hell does Harding know? He's a veterinarian, not a pathologist. 
What is it? 
That's it. 
That's what? 
I found the command to restore the original code. It resets the linked parameters. 
The fences and the power? 
Right. And it does something else. It erases the code lines that refer to it. It destroys all evidence it was ever there. 
Nedry could steal the eggs, get back and reset the whole show. No one would ever miss him. 
Watch this. 
Hot damn! 
Are the fences back on? 
You bet they are. It will take a few seconds to get up to full power, because we've got fift y miles of fence out there, and the generator has to feed the capacitors along the way. But in a half a minute we'll be back in business. 
Motion sensors? 
Got them too. It will be a few minutes while the computer counts. Then I'll tell you where Grant and the kids are and you can go and get them. But every- thing's working. Half past ten and we've got the whole thing back up and running. 
Just hiss. 
What is taking so damn long? Where are they? 
There's a lot of extraneous movement out there. Branches blowing, birds, back- ground movement. It may take, ah, okay, count's finished. 
Hmmmm. I don't see them. Maybe they're out of range of a sensor. 
Shit. I don't know where they are. I wish I could go out there But I haven't got anything to use on the Rex. My rocket launcher's in the jeep Nedry stole. And going out with a big gun in the dark would be suicide 
Why don't you get some sleep, Dr. Wu? I'm just going to run a couple more tests and then I'm going to turn in myself. 
No point in everyone being exhausted. 
I'm sure Muldoon will find Dr. Grant as soon as there is light. 
He gonna eat us? 
I don't think so. She's a ... 
... herbivore. 
Come here, babies! Get your b reakfast! 
Like the trike. Maybe it's not the stones. 
Where the hell are they going? 
Let's see what's up. 
Tim, I think there's a motion sensor across the field and down there. 
Where's Lex? 
C'mere boy, c'mere. 
It's very, very good. 
C'mere boy, c'mere. 
Dr. Grant, Dr. Grant, look. 
Whoa! 
Giddyup! 
Whoa!! Take is easy! 
I can't swim! 
Go home now. Home to Freda! 
Oh, let him stay. He likes me to ride him. He could carry me instead of you, Dr. Grant. Please, let him stay, 
Go! Go away. Go! Get out of here! 
Will I ever play with him again? 
We gotta get to that motion detector. It's still a ways. 
I found Nedry! 
I found him! 
Found him! 
He, Donald. Glad you're awake. I hope you're not going to take this little mishap you had and hold it against my park. It would be terrible if the finishing funds were in any way held up. 
You really shouldn't have gotten out of the vehicle. The park is actually quite safe. A disenchanted worker sabotaged some equipment. Arnold, Muldoon, and Wu, all loyal employees, are righting damage 
Oh good, 'cause I love the park! It's more than we ever dreamed! Those brachiosaurs are so big! And those Spitters - - incredible! I only have one problem. Aren't we going to have pterodactyls? Oh, they'd fly away! 
Take a look at these, Donald. Have you seen these? These are great. 
Wind-up toys. Spitter umbrellas. 
I got some great t-shirts. Dinosaur bingo, hey ... 
Wu says he can make a foot high 
You'll have to bear with him, Mr. Hammond. He's doped to infinity and back. 
Who gave you permission - 
I'm here to investigate this park. And there's plenty you haven't told me. 
That's absurd. 
These bones aren't fully formed. 
You're qualified to interpret x-rays of living dinosaurs? I doubt it. It took me many months to learn. 
You're making a lot of assumptions here. 
Right. What the hell is going on, Wu? 
Growth hormones. 
She didn't have a right to explore my lab. 
Let's not argue, Wu, we have a serious problem. These animals don't last. There is a regularity, a predictability about when they die. It's always ... very young. We don't know why. Given time, I'm sure Wu will figure it out. It's just ... 
Just some adjustment in the code is required. 
But there are deadlines. The park opens next summer. And it requires full-grown specimens. So Wu uses growth hormones to achieve the desired size in a short amount of time. But they all keep dying and we don't know how to stop it. 
I was going to tell you all this myself, Dr. Sattler, after Gennaro stopped breathing down my neck. That's why I wanted you and Dr. Grant here on my island - you have to help me keep the dinosaurs alive. Won't you please help me? 
Gennaro's losing a lot of blood. He needs transfusions. We gotta get a rescue helicopter. Arnold, what's with the phones? 
Ah hell. I just can't find it. 
Find what? 
Nedry jammed all the communication lines. He inserted some command, a lockout into the program code. I can't find it, because I gave that restore command and it erased part of the program listings. 
So? Just reset - shut the system down and you'll clear the memory. Everything will be in the normal wakeup mode. 
Shut the system down? 
And reset. 
I've never done that before. And I'm reluctant to do it. Maybe it's tr ue, all systems will come on, but maybe they won't. 
Look, there is a sick man here who needs medical attention or he'll die. Four people are out there, missing in your park. We need search teams. We have to have a phone or radio. 
Well? 
Well, it's just that the safety systems don't function with the computer shut down and - 
- turn the goddamn safety systems off! Can't you get it through your head that we have no choice? 
Okay. 
You asked for it. And you got it. 
How long do we have to wait? 
Thirty seconds. 
What is it? 
I hear something. 
Come on. 
Hear it now? 
You're hearing things. Come on, we gotta get back and warn them about the boat. 
What's going on? 
They're agitated. 
I told you I heard something! 
Outta the way, kids! Run! 
Memory should be cleared by now. 
Damn. 
What's wrong? 
Oh hell! I have to turn the safety switches back on before I restart the power. 
Thank God! 
Arnold! They're still not working. 
No, it sounds dead but after a reset, all system modules have to be brought on line manually. 
Arnold's about to get the phones up. 
Okay, we're up again! 
No we're not. Phones still dead. 
Can't be - 
My God, look at this, Arnold. 
What's happening? 
The duckbills. 
My good God. 
What? 
It's the Rex ... 
They've stampeded ... 
- A huge adult foot almost tramples the infant. 
Let's go. Now! 
No! Oh no! He make a kill. He killed one of my animals! Where's Muldoon? 
I'm sorry, Mr. Hammond. 
My animals! My animals! 
Where have you been? My Rex killed a hadrosaur. You should be out there, doing something. 
I just came to tell you - you're minus one computer expert. 
We'll walk by the river. That leads back to the Visitor's center. 
Not me. I'm not walking anymore. 
Come on Lex, I'll carry you. 
Nope. Too scared. 
You ready? 
Can we go on the raft? Then we don't have to walk so close to the animals! 
What raft? 
It's still mid-morning. I bet we have at least ten miles to go. If we take the raft along the river, we can make much faster progress. 
Let's do it. 
Lex, I don't see any raft. 
Keep going. 
Bullseye! 
Told you! 
No raft. Where did you see it, Lex? 
Actually, I never really saw one. Just assumed. 
Assumed? 
Lex! Lex! You're okay, you're okay! 
Look, Lex! Look! 
I'm afraid there's no raft. 
Looks pretty calm. 
I'll row, Dr. Grant. 
No. 
Hey, we're still moving. 
There's a current. 
You can't sleep. 
I'm not sl eeping... yet. 
I'll do it! 
We gotta warn them about the boat. 
Cool! 
Thought is looked calm? 
Guess I was wrong. 
I can't swim! 
Hold on real tight. 
Hold my hand. Hold my hand when we go. 
Don't let go! 
You can do it! 
I'm trying. I'm trying ... Ooooo!!! .... 
No!!!!! 
Son-of-a-bitch. He's taking a nap. Hasn't been this well fed ... ever. 
Could he drown in that position? That's a very valuable animal. 
I know it's a valuable animal. 
What's that, John? 
You running on auxiliary power? 
I'm not. 
Looks like you are. 
Can't be. 
Print the system status log. 
What the hell is going on? 
You're ruining my ordered, precise park! 
Fix my park, Arnold! Fix it! 
I know it's hard, I know it's hard, but I'm going to put it all back together for you - I promise. I will 
The waterfall stopped. 
Waterfalls aren't supposed to stop. 
I think they cut the power. Hey - 
Well, there's our pot of gold. Let's go, kids. 
TROL ROOM - 
Told him, fix my park, fix my park. 
You shut down as six thirty-four this morning, and when you started back up, it was with auxiliary power. 
Jesus. The auxiliary generator fires up first and then that's used to start the main generator because it needs a heavy charge. The main generator has to be manually reset. 
Outside? In the generator building? 
This doesn't mean the fences have been off since six-thirty, does it? 
Backup power doesn't generate enough amperage to power the electrified fences, so they were automatically kept off. That's also why we had no phones or radio. 
All of the fences? 
Yes. 
Including the velociraptor mesh? 
Yes, yes, yes. 
Do you mean those raptor s could be loose? 
I'm afraid so. 
No, no way. Last time, it took 'em two days to chew through that mesh. But give 'em enough time, they'll get out. We better get that power on now. 
Regardless, check the pit. Make sure there' five of them there. 
What's that steam coming out of my generator room? 
Relax, it's just refrigerated air. There's a leaky cooling pipe. I fixed it a couple times before but the original installation was at too sharp an angle. 
Just go and turn on your generator, then get right back to the control room. 
Raptors chewed their way out. All five are out there. 
Arnold's not with you? 
I was hoping he was ba ck here already. 
This is why my quarters were specially fortified. To assist in an emergency just like this one. Let's go. Muldoon, round up the workers. They'll go with us too. 
Wait. What about Arnold? 
We're home! 
Sorry, Tim. We gotta climb up. 
That's all right, Dr. Grant. You owe me 
Okay Wu, I'll have you covered at every moment. But this shell carries quite a punch, so if you're too close, it'll take a piece of you. Ellie's on the headset with you. If another ones come at you, let her know. Then Ellie - you start jumping and yelling. The buggers are easily distracted. They'll come running and let Wu get that power on. Then both of you, get behind this fence as quick as possible. 
Wu, get away. Give me room to shoot. 
Hey you cretaceous dromaeosaur, you can't catch me. Hey, come and get me, you flat-snouted Mongolian beast. Hey! 
You ok? 
Now, there's four. 
I'm going in. Muldoon, cover the door after I go in. Wu, guide me! 
Damn, I banged my head. 
Oh that's good, that must be the water pipe. You're really close now, there's a cabinet just above your head. Reach up and open it. The handle turns to the left. 
It's a large throw-switch. Pull it down, count to three, and push it back up. That's all there is to it. 
One - 
Two - 
Three! 
We did it! 
We made it! 
Raptor! 
Keep it open! I'm coming! 
Come on, Wu! Come on! Run! 
They're coming inside! 
Help! 
No they're not, Ellie. 
I couldn't compromise everyone's safety. 
Why didn't the power go on? 
You just reset the power. Now the computer has to be booted. 
Where did everybody go? 
Probably your grandfather's quarters. Let's go. 
Actually, stay here. 
No, I want to stay with you. 
No, keep an eye on things round here for me. I'll be back with the others. 
What about - 
I'll radio the ship as soon as I find somebody. You're in charge now. Don't move from here ... unless you have to, ok? 
Goody! I'm gonna rest. 
Tired! He carried you the whole way. 
Be right back. 
Why don't you just nail that bastard? 
No more ammo. I requisitioned six charges but the bean-counter - - cut it down to two. 
Any candy behind the counter? 
Hungry? 
Starved. 
Nothing. 
Let's go to the kitchen. 
Dr. Grant said - 
- let's go. We'll come right back. 
Nope. We're waiting here t ill Dr. Grant gets back. He'll help us get some - 
Start winding now! 
Where are we going? 
The kitchen! 
How long? 
Well, they seem to be getting faster all the time. I would say - fifteen minutes. 
There's a raptor on the roof of this building. Open that gate and you're a dead man. 
Ellie, I'm go glad - 
Shut up and listen. We have about fifteen minutes here. The computer has to be rebooted. That'll turn on the electric fences. Besides the r aptor stuck in here with us, there are four more ... 
We'll freeze to death in there. 
He's going to eat us! 
PUSH! 
What is it, Timmy? 
I just remembered something. Rapto rs are born in large litters. There's probably more coming. We gotta hide. 
Talk, Ellie, just keep talking. 
Timmy, you know anything about computers? 
Well, I just got an XT at home. I told my Dad I wanted a 386. 
Ok good, you're elected. 
Okay, we've reached the computer room. Who can te ll Timmy how to reboot? 
Ah, Alan, nobody here knows how to boot the computer. Please hurry, we've only got a couple minutes left. 
Tim, you got to book the system. They reset the power and there are no phones. We gotta turn on the fences and we gotta stop that ship. 
Are they going to be ok? 
If we can get help very soon. 
Sshh, you guys, I'm thinking. 
Ellie, we're working as fast as we can here. 
Ok, we're all right here for now. 
Don't mention it. It was Timmy. 
But there's still one more raptor. So be careful. 
I think this is the boat. They called it the Queen Anne or something. 
Queen Anne, do you read me? Queen Anne? 
This is the Queen Anne B? I copy. What's up? 
Report your position! 
Ah, we're just about to dock here in Puntaremas. Who wants to know? Please identify yourself. 
Grant reads it and nods. His voice is tough as nails. 
Try this for identification, Captain Farrell. You are in possession of stolen biological materials. If you don't turn that boat around and return to Isla Nublar immediately with your contraband cargo, you will be found in violation of Section 509 of the Uniform Maritime Act, you will be subject to revocation of license, penalties in excess of fifty thousand dollars, and five years in jail. Do you copy? 
Do you copy, Captain Farrell? 
I copy. All ahead stern. 
What's the Uniform Maritime Code? 
Who the hell knows? 
What good does that do? To have the ship turn around? 
Well it gives us ten more hours. Let's see if we can raise the Costa Rican Coast Guard on that thing. 
And then there were none. 
Dr. Grant, don't abandon this beautiful place. I need a man just like you to help me get my park back on its feet again. And it will be on its feet again. 
We have to leave now. 
Oh you don't know. There are wonderful plans in the works, sites already purchased for Euro-Jurassic and Jurassic Japan. 
Don't you see I've exalted human potential here? You must see it. You must feel it. I called back a life form. Listen, Dr. Grant, don't go. Be a part of this. I'm inviting you to do just that - let the others go, if they want. 
You interrupted natural law. There are regulations, rules that nature follows that make her knowable. 
You mean there are rules that nature follows that create barriers to our knowledge. 
Barriers? Like the seasons? The earth spinning, orbiting the sun? The entire solar system in interlocking motion. Our own beings in biological step with it all. Mr. Hammond, you've disrupted the pattern and look what it's done! 
I know what it's done. I've made triceratops and gallimimus and a T-Rex. I've got a batch of iguanadons being born on Tuesday. What do you say to that? 
Don't count on it. Now get in. 
You created mutant forms that you further mutated to create amus ement attractions. You made biological puppets with heartbeats and an early death sentence. 
I created genetic miracles! 
You created a park to generate a profit- making merchandising operation. 
The merchandise is just a by-product. Souvenirs for people to reflect on the wonder. You fainted when you saw the brachiosaur. Alan, look, let's not argue. The problem is that my employees were not up to par with my dream. They failed me. The park, I promise you, is safe. It really is. 
You park is doomed. Now come with me. 
It is not! It's blooming! In the throes of labor! You are one more more negative voice in a universe of negativity. You'll amount to nothing. You'll be a bone-brusher all your life. I pity you. 
Come back, Mr. Hammond! It's over! 
They're so beautiful. They're condemned, aren't they? Even those embryo fragments had the same viral contamination. 
I have a theory. 
You have a theory? 
So the very process itself was flawed.

# Representation of Women in IMDb Top 250
IMDb Top 250 Movies Timeline 
What do the highest rated movies of a time say about the people who watch them? From the 1950s to the 2020s, the IMDb top 250 movies represent the changing mindsets of audiences and directors. The way we represent women in films speaks volumes about the societal mindset towards them. We aim to explore the question- how do the top films represent women and how has that changed over time?
Bechdel Test: How to Assess the Representation of Women?
In our analysis of women's representation in film, the [Bechdel Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test) serves as a crucial benchmark. This test, named after cartoonist Alison Bechdel, offers a simple way to gauge the presence and significance of female characters in movies. To pass the test, a film must meet three key criteria:
* In the chart on the left, movies are sorted based on their rank, with the highest ranked at the bottom.
Change in Bechdel Scores Over Time 
We analyzed the proportion of top 250 movies by decade that pass the Bechdel Test, presented through a 100% stacked area chart. A gradual increase in films passing the Bechdel Test is observed, especially noticeable in the 2010s. The 1980s have the lowest number of movies that pass the Bechdel Test.
Genre-wise Bechdel Score Distribution
Since women's representation various greatly across genres, we plotted the Bechdel scores of the top 250 movies using a beeswam chart. We can see that genres like crime, action, and adventure were almost entirely male-centric, are doing better in recent years.
Change unit size by
PopularityGrossNone
So, do movies with better representation of women get more popularity and revenue? We mapped unit size to IMDB votes and worldwide gross. While votes don't seem to have much to do with whether or not a movie passes the test, we can see that recent big grossing movies all passed the Bechdel test.
Beyond the Bechdel Test
Besides the Bechdel Score, we looked at other indicators of women's representation:   

Director's Gender
Considering the significant male dominance in film direction, we explored how many top 250 films were directed by women. Unfortunately, only a handful of these films had female directors.
Beyond the Bechdel Test
Script Insights
The Bechdel Test is an initial gauge of female representation in films, highlighting the presence of women. However, it doesn't assess the depth or complexity of female characters and narratives. A deeper script analysis can reveal more, as seen in movies like 'Jaws' and 'Jurassic Park'. Both pass the Bechdel Test and fall under the adventure genre, yet they show notable differences in how female characters are portrayed.
Highlighting Female Dialogue in Scripts
To assess the frequency and prominence of female dialogue in film scripts, we highlighted dialogues of female characters in the scripts. In 'Jurassic Park,' female dialogue comprised nearly half of the script and was evenly distributed across the film. This is in contrast to 'Jaws,' where female dialogue is primarily confined to specific scenes only, highlighting the differences in how female characters are given a voice in these movies.
A Segment-Based Female Dialogue Proportion
To facilitate a clear comparison of where and how much women speak from the beginning to the end of a movie, we created a waffle chart visualization. By segmenting each movie script into 100 equal parts, the chart fills in colors based on the proportion of women's dialogues in each segment. This method provides an at-a-glance view, enabling an easy comparison of female dialogue distribution throughout the films.
Emotional Analysis of Dialogues
Additionally, we visualized the diversity of emotions expressed by women in comparison to men in films through sentiment analysis of movie dialogues. This approach helps us determine how multidimensionally women are portrayed. For instance, in 'Jaws,' female dialogues predominantly revolved around anger and joy. In contrast, 'Jurassic Park' showcased a broader spectrum of emotions in female dialogues, indicating a more nuanced and richer representation of women.
Now, let's dive into the portrayal of women in top 250 movie scripts. Click on the waffle chart to see script sentiment analysis and gender representation in movie posters.

Thank you for your interest in joining our group!

In short, each year we usually accept 
  * 1-2 PhD students (e.g., CSE, CS, ML)
  * 0-2 master students
  * 0-3 undergraduate students
  * 0-1 postdocs
  * no summer interns


LONG VERSION -----

For INCOMING PHD students, looking for ADVISOR:
    We ONLY consider people who have been admitted
       * to the PHD programs of CSE, CS, or ML

To applicants for PHD ADMISSION:
    SHORT version: there is little I can do.
    LONG version: 
        The decisions are made by the admission committee, 
        after input from faculty. Thus, faculty like me, can not give you
        any guarantee - only hints to maximize your chances for acceptance - see below.

    VERY IMPORTANT: 
        My best advice is for you to try to obtain a recommendation letter that compares you favorably to an earlier 
        Georgia Tech graduate student, or equivalent (CMU, Stanford, MIT, Berkeley, UIUC, Cornell, UW, etc).  
        
	Points of reference:
	* Minsuk Kahng https://minsuk.com
	* Shang-Tse Chen https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~stchen/
	* Fred Hohman https://fredhohman.com
	* Acar Tamersoy https://acartamersoy.github.io
	* Robert Pienta http://spicy.bike
    * Scott Freitas http://www.scottfreitas.com/
	etc


To applicants for SUMMER INTERNSHIP:
    Unfortunately, we have no such positions.
    (Too little face-to-face time, to make it worthwhile for you 
    to go through all the trouble of relocation, visa  etc.)

To incoming MASTER students, looking for research ADVISOR:
    We ONLY consider people who have already been admitted
       * to the Master programs of CSE, CS, ML, Analytics, and programs that College of Computing participates in
    Master program admission is considered at the program level, thus your admission to Georgia Tech is
    determined at by the program.

To applicants for POSTDOC POSITION:
    Possible, if ALL these conditions hold:
        (a) you have secured independent funding covering all expenses
                 AND
        (b) your ex-advisor is willing to compare you favorably 
            to an earlier Georgia Tech (or equivalent) graduate
                 AND
        (c) there is enough overlap among our *current* research interests
	    (human-centered AI, visualization, graphs, AI security, etc)

Over the last decade, the volume of conference submissions in machine learning has broken records across the sciences. According to some estimates, submissions at machine learning conferences account for over 0.5% of all scientific papers published today. While submissions are at an all-time high, there is growing concern in the ML community about where the field is headed. The current pandemic gives researchers a long-awaited opportunity to pause and reflect: what kind of legacy do we want to leave behind? Is it in the number of papers we publish, or the number of citations we accumulate? Or, is it in the clarity and transparency of scientific communication? We believe the answers to these questions will shape the next few years of ML research.
How might we improve the scientific paper to create a more sustainable platform for future contributors? Many proposals have emerged, from novelty and rigor ([Sculley et al., 2018](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rJWF0Fywf)), to reproducibility ([Pineau et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12206)), explainability ([Olah and Carter, 2017](https://distill.pub/2017/research-debt/)) and accessibility ([Morris, 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08939)). In an era of social isolation and remote work, the importance of clear communication is crucial, both for demonstrating scientific progress and building human intuition and understanding. We propose taking a more holistic view of the conference paper, not just as a medium for communicating with a highly sophisticated audience, but as a tool for disseminating knowledge to the next generation of scientific researchers. In this workshop, to be organized at [ICLR 2021](https://iclr.cc/) we propose to discuss three high-level themes:
  * Accessibility and inclusivity - How do we design an inclusive publication format for ML research?
  * Explainability and pedagogy - How do we communicate ML research and theory more effectively?
  * Interpretability and visualization - How do we interpret complex information in a visual setting?


The research paper was originally a document printed and bound in journals: over time, these documents were published online and underwent minor cosmetic changes, yet many assumptions of the original format survive, namely, that research must take the form of a paper artifact. Yet modern ML research often contains multimedia and rich interactive applications, often hosted externally and can be displaced or go missing. To accommodate the diversity of new content, authors and publishers must adopt a more inclusive format for sharing scientific research and redesign conference publications to meet the evolving information needs of both authors and readers alike.
Among the ML research community, there is a variety of innovative content that does not reach traditional machine learning conferences. By showcasing work from ML researchers on the frontiers of digital publication, we hope to raise awareness for alternative writing styles and templates for publication. How can we improve understanding through scientific communication? How can we make the medium more inclusive and accessible for current and future contributors? These are some of the themes we hope to explore in our workshop. Please join us for an exciting discussion on redesigning the scientific paper for machine learning research!

Hi, I'm Anthony, a CS PhD at ![](https://shengyun-peng.github.io/images/gatech.svg) Georgia Tech working with [Polo Chau](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dchau/). My research advances **safer, more efficient, and robust AI systems at scale** — spanning training, inference, and deployment — by tackling core challenges in safety alignment, inference efficiency, and scalable system design across language, vision, and multimodal models: 
**• Advancing Safety Alignment Throughout Model Training** : LLM safety basin, the first framework explaining how minimal unsafe data can collapse alignment during fine-tuning ([NeurIPS'24](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17374)); robust CNN architectures that achieved SOTA on RobustBench ([BMVC'23 with Best Poster Award](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16258)); dynamic safety shaping framework for LLM finetuning risk mitigation (In Submission).   
**• Optimizing Inference for Scalability and Throughput** : video VLM scaling study for optimal inference ([ACL'25](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18855)); token reduction method that doubles LLM inference throughput (In Submission); a scalable framework that empowers MLLMs to understand composite images ([ICCV'25](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05243)).   
**• Bridging Research and Deployment for Real-World Impact** : UniTable, a modular table parsing system with over 470+ stars (workshops at [NeurIPS'23 (oral)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05565), [AAAI'24 (oral)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15578), & [NeurIPS'24](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04822)); distributed systems tutorials on Medium (33K+ readers).

Transformer Block 1
### What is Transformer?
✕
**Transformer** is the core architecture behind modern AI, powering models like ChatGPT and Gemini. Introduced in 2017, it revolutionized how AI processes information. The same architecture is used for training on massive datasets and for inference to generate outputs. Here we use GPT-2 (small), simpler than newer ones but perfect for learning the fundamentals.
Transformers aren't magic—they build text step by step by asking:
> "What is the most probable next word that will follow this input?" 
Here we explore how a trained model generates text. Write your own text or use an example, then click **Generate** to see it in action. If the model isn’t ready yet, try another **Example**.
Transformer has three main parts:
1
**Embeddings** turn text into numbers.
2
**Transformer blocks** mix information with Self-Attention and refine it with an MLP.
3
**Probabilities** determine the likelihood of each next token.
Before a Transformer can use text, it first breaks it into small units and represents each as a list of numbers (vector). This process is called **embedding** , and the term can refer to both the process and the resulting vector.
In this tool, each vector appears as a rectangle, and hovering over it shows its size.
**Tokenization** splits input text into tokens—small units like words or parts of words. GPT-2 (small) has 50,257 token vocabulary, each with a unique ID.
In the **token embedding** step, every token is matched to a 768-number vector from a large lookup table. These vectors are learned during training to best represent each token’s meaning.
Word order matters in language. **Positional encoding** gives each token information about its place in the sequence.
GPT-2 does this by adding a learned positional embedding to the token's embedding, but newer models may use other methods, like RoPE, which encodes position by rotating certain vectors. All aim to help the model understand order in text.
A **Transformer block** is the main unit of processing in the model. It has two parts:
  * **Multi-head self-attention** – lets tokens share information
  * **MLP** – refines each token's details


Models stack many blocks so token representations become richer as they pass through. GPT-2 (small) has 12 of them.
**Self-attention** lets the model decide which parts of the input are most relevant to each token. This helps it capture meaning and relationships, even between far-apart words.
In **multi-head** form, the model runs several attention processes in parallel, each focusing on different patterns in the text.
To perform self-attention, each token's embedding is transformed into three new embeddings— Query, Key, and Value. This transformation is done by applying different weights and biases to each token embedding. These parameters (weights and biases), are optimized through training.
Once created, Queries compare with Keys to measure relevance, and this relevance is used to weight the Values.
After creating Q, K, and V embeddings, the model splits them into several **heads** (12 in GPT-2 small). Each head works with its own smaller set of Q/K/V, focusing on different patterns in the text—like grammar, meaning, or long-range links.
Multiple heads let the model learn many kinds of relationships in parallel, making its understanding richer.
In each head, the model decides how much each token focuses on others:
  * **Dot Product** – Multiply matching numbers in Query/Key vectors, sum to get attention scores.
  * **Mask** – Hide future tokens so it can't peek ahead.
  * **Softmax** – Convert scores to probabilities, each row summing to 1, showing focus on earlier tokens.


Each head multiplies its attention scores with the Value embeddings to produce its attention output—a refined representation of each token after considering context.
GPT-2 (small) has 12 such outputs, which are concatenated to form a single vector of the original size (768 numbers).
The attention output goes through an **MLP** to refine token representations. A Linear layer changes embedding values and size using learned weights and bias, then a non-linear activation decides how much each value passes.
Many activation types exist; GPT-2 uses **GELU** , which lets small values pass partially and large values pass fully, helping capture both subtle and strong patterns.
After all Transformer blocks, the last token's output embedding, enriched with context from all previous tokens, is multiplied by learned weights in a final layer.
This produces **logits** , 50,257 numbers—one for each token in GPT-2’s vocabulary—that indicate how likely each token is to come next.
Logits are just raw scores. To make them easier to interpret, we convert them into **probabilities** between 0 and 1, where all add up to 1. This tells us the likelihood of each token being the next word.
Instead of always picking the highest-probability token, we can use different selection strategies to balance safety and creativity in the generated text.
**Temperature** works by scaling the logits before turning them into probabilities. A **low temperature** (e.g., 0.2) makes large logits even larger and small ones smaller, favoring the highest-scoring tokens and leading to more **predictable choices**. A **high temperature** (e.g., 1.0 or above) flattens the differences, making less likely tokens more competitive and leading to more **creative outputs**.
Finally, we need a strategy to pick the next token. Many exist, but here are common ones: Greedy search picks the top one. **Top-k** keeps only the k most likely tokens, and **top-p** keeps the smallest set whose total probability is at least p—trimming unlikely ones early.
Then softmax turns the remaining logits into probabilities, and one token is picked at random from the allowed set.
Transformers have extra features that enhance the model performance but aren't core to understanding the basics. For example, a **residual connection** adds a layer's input to its output, keeping information and learning signals from fading through many layers. In GPT-2, it's used twice per block to train deeper stacks effectively.
**Layer Normalization** helps stabilize both training and inference by adjusting input numbers so their mean and variance stay consistent. This makes the model less sensitive to its starting weights and helps it learn more effectively. In GPT-2, it's applied before self-attention, before the MLP, and once more before the final output.
During training, **dropout** randomly turns off some connections between numbers so the model doesn't overfit to specific patterns. This helps it learn features that generalize better. GPT-2 uses it, but newer LLMs often skip it because they train on huge datasets and overfitting is less of a problem. In inference, dropout is turned off.

# What is a Transformer?
Transformer is a neural network architecture that has fundamentally changed the approach to Artificial Intelligence. Transformer was first introduced in the seminal paper ["Attention is All You Need"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3295222.3295349 "ACM Digital Library") in 2017 and has since become the go-to architecture for deep learning models, powering text-generative models like OpenAI's **GPT** , Meta's **Llama** , and Google's **Gemini**. Beyond text, Transformer is also applied in [audio generation](https://huggingface.co/learn/audio-course/en/chapter3/introduction "Hugging Face"), [image recognition](https://huggingface.co/learn/computer-vision-course/unit3/vision-transformers/vision-transformers-for-image-classification "Hugging Face"), [protein structure prediction](https://elifesciences.org/articles/82819 "eLife"), and even [game playing](https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/reinforcement-learning-plus-transformers-equals-efficiency/ "Deep Learning AI"), demonstrating its versatility across numerous domains.
Fundamentally, text-generative Transformer models operate on the principle of **next-word prediction** : given a text prompt from the user, what is the _most probable next word_ that will follow this input? The core innovation and power of Transformers lie in their use of self-attention mechanism, which allows them to process entire sequences and capture long-range dependencies more effectively than previous architectures.
GPT-2 family of models are prominent examples of text-generative Transformers. Transformer Explainer is powered by the [GPT-2](https://huggingface.co/openai-community/gpt2 "Hugging Face") (small) model which has 124 million parameters. While it is not the latest or most powerful Transformer model, it shares many of the same architectural components and principles found in the current state-of-the-art models making it an ideal starting point for understanding the basics.
# Transformer Architecture
Every text-generative Transformer consists of these **three key components** :
  1. **Embedding** : Text input is divided into smaller units called tokens, which can be words or subwords. These tokens are converted into numerical vectors called embeddings, which capture the semantic meaning of words.
  2. **Transformer Block** is the fundamental building block of the model that processes and transforms the input data. Each block includes: 
     * **Attention Mechanism** , the core component of the Transformer block. It allows tokens to communicate with other tokens, capturing contextual information and relationships between words.
     * **MLP (Multilayer Perceptron) Layer** , a feed-forward network that operates on each token independently. While the goal of the attention layer is to route information between tokens, the goal of the MLP is to refine each token's representation.
  3. **Output Probabilities** : The final linear and softmax layers transform the processed embeddings into probabilities, enabling the model to make predictions about the next token in a sequence.


## Embedding
Let's say you want to generate text using a Transformer model. You add the prompt like this one: `“Data visualization empowers users to”`. This input needs to be converted into a format that the model can understand and process. That is where embedding comes in: it transforms the text into a numerical representation that the model can work with. To convert a prompt into embedding, we need to 1) tokenize the input, 2) obtain token embeddings, 3) add positional information, and finally 4) add up token and position encodings to get the final embedding. Let’s see how each of these steps is done.
![](https://poloclub.github.io/transformer-explainer/article_assets/embedding.png)
Figure 1. Expanding the Embedding layer view, showing how the input prompt is converted to a vector representation. The process involves (1) Tokenization, (2) Token Embedding, (3) Positional Encoding, and (4) Final Embedding.
### Step 1: Tokenization
Tokenization is the process of breaking down the input text into smaller, more manageable pieces called tokens. These tokens can be a word or a subword. The words `"Data"` and `"visualization"` correspond to unique tokens, while the word `"empowers"` is split into two tokens. The full vocabulary of tokens is decided before training the model: GPT-2's vocabulary has `50,257` unique tokens. Now that we split our input text into tokens with distinct IDs, we can obtain their vector representation from embeddings.
### Step 2. Token Embedding
GPT-2 (small) represents each token in the vocabulary as a 768-dimensional vector; the dimension of the vector depends on the model. These embedding vectors are stored in a matrix of shape `(50,257, 768)`, containing approximately 39 million parameters! This extensive matrix allows the model to assign semantic meaning to each token.
### Step 3. Positional Encoding
The Embedding layer also encodes information about each token's position in the input prompt. Different models use various methods for positional encoding. GPT-2 trains its own positional encoding matrix from scratch, integrating it directly into the training process.
### Step 4. Final Embedding
Finally, we sum the token and positional encodings to get the final embedding representation. This combined representation captures both the semantic meaning of the tokens and their position in the input sequence.
## Transformer Block
The core of the Transformer's processing lies in the Transformer block, which comprises multi-head self-attention and a Multi-Layer Perceptron layer. Most models consist of multiple such blocks that are stacked sequentially one after the other. The token representations evolve through layers, from the first block to the last one, allowing the model to build up an intricate understanding of each token. This layered approach leads to higher-order representations of the input. The GPT-2 (small) model we are examining consists of `12` such blocks.
### Multi-Head Self-Attention
The self-attention mechanism enables the model to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence, allowing it to capture complex relationships and dependencies within the data. Let’s look at how this self-attention is computed step-by-step.
#### Step 1: Query, Key, and Value Matrices
![](https://poloclub.github.io/transformer-explainer/article_assets/QKV.png)
QKVij=(∑d=1768Embeddingi,d⋅Weightsd,j)+Biasj QKV_{ij} = ( \sum_{d=1}^{768} \text{Embedding}_{i,d} \cdot \text{Weights}_{d,j}) + \text{Bias}_j QKVij​=(d=1∑768​Embeddingi,d​⋅Weightsd,j​)+Biasj​
Figure 2. Computing Query, Key, and Value matrices from the original embedding.
Each token's embedding vector is transformed into three vectors: Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V). These vectors are derived by multiplying the input embedding matrix with learned weight matrices for Q, K, and V. Here's a web search analogy to help us build some intuition behind these matrices:
  * **Query (Q)** is the search text you type in the search engine bar. This is the token you want to _"find more information about"_.
  * **Key (K)** is the title of each web page in the search result window. It represents the possible tokens the query can attend to.
  * **Value (V)** is the actual content of web pages shown. Once we matched the appropriate search term (Query) with the relevant results (Key), we want to get the content (Value) of the most relevant pages.


By using these QKV values, the model can calculate attention scores, which determine how much focus each token should receive when generating predictions.
#### Step 2: Multi-Head Splitting
Query, key, and Value vectors are split into multiple heads—in GPT-2 (small)'s case, into `12` heads. Each head processes a segment of the embeddings independently, capturing different syntactic and semantic relationships. This design facilitates parallel learning of diverse linguistic features, enhancing the model's representational power.
#### Step 3: Masked Self-Attention
In each head, we perform masked self-attention calculations. This mechanism allows the model to generate sequences by focusing on relevant parts of the input while preventing access to future tokens.
![](https://poloclub.github.io/transformer-explainer/article_assets/attention.png)
Figure 3. Using Query, Key, and Value matrices to calculate masked self-attention.
  * **Attention Score** : The dot product of Query and Key matrices determines the alignment of each query with each key, producing a square matrix that reflects the relationship between all input tokens.
  * **Masking** : A mask is applied to the upper triangle of the attention matrix to prevent the model from accessing future tokens, setting these values to negative infinity. The model needs to learn how to predict the next token without “peeking” into the future.
  * **Softmax** : After masking, the attention score is converted into probability by the softmax operation which takes the exponent of each attention score. Each row of the matrix sums up to one and indicates the relevance of every other token to the left of it.


#### Step 4: Output and Concatenation
The model uses the masked self-attention scores and multiplies them with the Value matrix to get the final output of the self-attention mechanism. GPT-2 has `12` self-attention heads, each capturing different relationships between tokens. The outputs of these heads are concatenated and passed through a linear projection.
### MLP: Multi-Layer Perceptron
![](https://poloclub.github.io/transformer-explainer/article_assets/mlp.png)
Figure 4. Using MLP layer to project the self-attention representations into higher dimensions to enhance the model's representational capacity.
After the multiple heads of self-attention capture the diverse relationships between the input tokens, the concatenated outputs are passed through the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) layer to enhance the model's representational capacity. The MLP block consists of two linear transformations with a GELU activation function in between. The first linear transformation increases the dimensionality of the input four-fold from `768` to `3072`. The second linear transformation reduces the dimensionality back to the original size of `768`, ensuring that the subsequent layers receive inputs of consistent dimensions. Unlike the self-attention mechanism, the MLP processes tokens independently and simply map them from one representation to another.
## Output Probabilities
After the input has been processed through all Transformer blocks, the output is passed through the final linear layer to prepare it for token prediction. This layer projects the final representations into a `50,257` dimensional space, where every token in the vocabulary has a corresponding value called `logit`. Any token can be the next word, so this process allows us to simply rank these tokens by their likelihood of being that next word. We then apply the softmax function to convert the logits into a probability distribution that sums to one. This will allow us to sample the next token based on its likelihood.
![](https://poloclub.github.io/transformer-explainer/article_assets/softmax.png)
Figure 5. Each token in the vocabulary is assigned a probability based on the model's output logits. These probabilities determine the likelihood of each token being the next word in the sequence.
The final step is to generate the next token by sampling from this distribution The `temperature` hyperparameter plays a critical role in this process. Mathematically speaking, it is a very simple operation: model output logits are simply divided by the `temperature`:
  * `temperature = 1`: Dividing logits by one has no effect on the softmax outputs.
  * `temperature < 1`: Lower temperature makes the model more confident and deterministic by sharpening the probability distribution, leading to more predictable outputs.
  * `temperature > 1`: Higher temperature creates a softer probability distribution, allowing for more randomness in the generated text – what some refer to as model _“creativity”_.


In addition, the sampling process can be further refined using `top-k` and `top-p` parameters:
  * `top-k sampling`: Limits the candidate tokens to the top k tokens with the highest probabilities, filtering out less likely options.
  * `top-p sampling`: Considers the smallest set of tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds a threshold p, ensuring that only the most likely tokens contribute while still allowing for diversity.


By tuning `temperature`, `top-k`, and `top-p`, you can balance between deterministic and diverse outputs, tailoring the model's behavior to your specific needs.
## Advanced Architectural Features
There are several advanced architectural features that enhance the performance of Transformer models. While important for the model's overall performance, they are not as important for understanding the core concepts of the architecture. Layer Normalization, Dropout, and Residual Connections are crucial components in Transformer models, particularly during the training phase. Layer Normalization stabilizes training and helps the model converge faster. Dropout prevents overfitting by randomly deactivating neurons. Residual Connections allows gradients to flow directly through the network and helps to prevent the vanishing gradient problem.
### Layer Normalization
Layer Normalization helps to stabilize the training process and improves convergence. It works by normalizing the inputs across the features, ensuring that the mean and variance of the activations are consistent. This normalization helps mitigate issues related to internal covariate shift, allowing the model to learn more effectively and reducing the sensitivity to the initial weights. Layer Normalization is applied twice in each Transformer block, once before the self-attention mechanism and once before the MLP layer.
### Dropout
Dropout is a regularization technique used to prevent overfitting in neural networks by randomly setting a fraction of model weights to zero during training. This encourages the model to learn more robust features and reduces dependency on specific neurons, helping the network generalize better to new, unseen data. During model inference, dropout is deactivated. This essentially means that we are using an ensemble of the trained subnetworks, which leads to a better model performance.
### Residual Connections
Residual connections were first introduced in the ResNet model in 2015. This architectural innovation revolutionized deep learning by enabling the training of very deep neural networks. Essentially, residual connections are shortcuts that bypass one or more layers, adding the input of a layer to its output. This helps mitigate the vanishing gradient problem, making it easier to train deep networks with multiple Transformer blocks stacked on top of each other. In GPT-2, residual connections are used twice within each Transformer block: once before the MLP and once after, ensuring that gradients flow more easily, and earlier layers receive sufficient updates during backpropagation.
# Interactive Features
Transformer Explainer is built to be interactive and allows you to explore the inner workings of the Transformer. Here are some of the interactive features you can play with:
  * **Input your own text sequence** to see how the model processes it and predicts the next word. Explore attention weights, intermediate computations, and see how the final output probabilities are calculated.
  * **Use temperature slider** to control the randomness of the model’s predictions. Explore how you can make the model output more deterministic or more creative by changing the temperature value.
  * **Select top-k and top-p sampling methods** to adjust sampling behavior during inference. Experiment with different values and see how the probability distribution changes and influences the model's predictions.
  * **Interact with attention maps** to see how the model focuses on different tokens in the input sequence. Hover over tokens to highlight their attention weights and explore how the model captures context and relationships between words.

#  What is PeopleMap? 
Discovering research expertise at institutions can be a difficult task. Manually curated university directories easily become out of date and often lack the information necessary to understand a researcher’s interests and past work, making it harder to explore the diversity of research at an institution and pinpoint potential collaborators, resulting in lost opportunities for both internal and external entities to discover new connections and nurture research collaboration. 
To solve this problem, we have developed PeopleMap, the first interactive, open-source, web-based tool that visually “maps out”researchers based on their research interests and publications by leveraging embeddings generated by natural language processing (NLP) techniques. PeopleMap provides a new engaging way for institutions to summarize their research talents and for people to discover new connections. PeopleMap is developed with ease-of-use and sustainability in mind. Using only researchers’ Google Scholar profiles as input, PeopleMap can be readily adopted by any institution using its publicly-accessible repository and detailed documentation.

Abstract
Skeleton-based human action recognition technologies are increasingly used in video based applications, such as home robotics, healthcare on aging population, and surveillance. However, such models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, raising serious concerns for their use in safety-critical applications. To develop an effective defense against attacks, it is essential to understand how such attacks mislead the pose detection models into making incorrect predictions. We present SkeletonVis, the first interactive system that visualizes how the attacks work on the models to enhance human understanding of attacks.
